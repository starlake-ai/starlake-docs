id: access-control
title: Grant and revoke access
---

Access control is **off by default** (`acl.enabled=false`). Set `QOD_ACL_ENABLED=true` to enforce it. When ACL is on, every FlightSQL statement is matched against the caller's effective permission set before execution. The model - roles, groups, verbs, and wildcards - is described in [Access control model](/qod/operating/rbac-model).

## Grant a team read access

**Goal:** Let a group of users run SELECT statements against one or more tables in a pool.

**Prerequisites:** A tenant and a pool already exist. You are signed in as a superuser or the tenant's admin.

**Steps (UI):**

1. Open the **Users** section (top nav) and select the target tenant from the tenant selector.
2. Go to the **Roles** tab and click **+ New role**. Give the role a name (for example `bi-readers`). Add a table permission with verb `RO` (read) and the target catalog, schema, and table (use `*` to wildcard any field). Save.

3. Go to the **Groups** tab and click **+ New group**. Name it (for example `bi-team`). Add the `bi-readers` role to the group. Save.

   ![Groups tab](/img/ui/rbac-groups.png)

4. Go to the **Users** tab. For each user who needs access, open their record, assign them to the `bi-team` group, and add a pool grant for the target pool. The pool grant is required for the user to connect to that pool.

   ![Users tab](/img/ui/rbac-users.png)

5. Confirm the pool grant: in the **Users** tab, verify the user's row shows the pool grant for the target pool.

**Manifest (YAML)**

```yaml
roles:
  - tenant: acme
    name: analyst
    permissions:
      - { catalog: acme_tpch, schema: tpch1, table: customer, verb: RO }
groups:
  - tenant: acme
    name: analysts
    roles: [analyst]
users:
  - tenant: acme
    username: alice
    groups: [analysts]
    poolGrants:
      - { pool: bi }
```

**CLI equivalent:**

The examples below assume `qod login` has stored a session (see [the CLI section](/qod/cli/)); CI scripts can use `QOD_API_KEY` instead. The six steps below mirror the UI flow exactly. Surrogate ids (`<roleId>`, `<groupId>`, etc.) are returned by each create call; capture them with the `--json` flag.

```bash
# 1. Create a role
ROLE_ID=$(qod --json role create --tenant acme --name analyst --description "Read-only analyst" | jq -r .id)

# 2. Grant RO (read) on acme_tpch.tpch1.customer (repeat per table, or use "*" to wildcard any field)
qod role permission grant --role-id "$ROLE_ID" --catalog acme_tpch --schema tpch1 --table customer --verb RO

# 3. Create a group
GROUP_ID=$(qod --json group create --tenant acme --name analysts | jq -r .id)

# 4. Attach the role to the group
qod membership group-role add --group-id "$GROUP_ID" --role-id "$ROLE_ID"

# 5. Add a user to the group (or use `qod membership user-role add` to attach the role directly to a user)
#    Retrieve <userId> from `qod user list --tenant acme`
qod membership user-group add --user-id <userId> --group-id "$GROUP_ID"

# 6. Grant the group access to the pool (REQUIRED - without this the group cannot reach the pool)
#    Retrieve <poolId> from `qod pool list`
qod pool permission grant --tenant acme --pool-id <poolId> --group-id "$GROUP_ID"
```

The permission graph is: user -> roles (direct), user -> groups -> roles (via group membership), plus a required pool permission that gates which pools the principal can reach.

## Grant DML or DDL

**Goal:** Let a role run INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or schema-altering statements.

**Prerequisites:** A role already exists (or follow the steps above to create one).

**Steps (UI):**

1. Open **Users** > **Roles** tab and click the edit icon on the target role.
2. Add one or more table permissions with the appropriate verb:
   - `RW` for DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, TRUNCATE) - it also covers reads on the same table
   - `DDL` for schema changes (CREATE, DROP, ALTER)
   - `ALL` to cover every verb at once
3. Save. The verbs are collapsed to `Read`, `Write`, or `Ddl` at enforcement time; see [Access control model](/qod/operating/rbac-model) for the exact mapping.

**Manifest (YAML)**

```yaml
roles:
  - tenant: acme
    name: loader
    permissions:
      - { catalog: acme_tpch, schema: tpch1, table: orders, verb: RW }
```

**CLI equivalent:**

```bash
# Grant RW (DML) on acme_tpch.tpch1.orders to an existing role
qod role permission grant --role-id <roleId> --catalog acme_tpch --schema tpch1 --table orders --verb RW

# Grant ALL verbs on every table in the catalog (wildcard schema and table)
qod role permission grant --role-id <roleId> --catalog acme_tpch --schema "*" --table "*" --verb ALL
```

Replace `verb` with `DDL` for schema changes as needed. Omitting `catalog`/`schema`/`table` (or setting them to `"*"`) wildcards that field.

**Verify:** See [Verify access](#verify-access) below.

## Table name resolution

When ACL is on, a two-part name `schema.table` resolves against the session's default catalog (ANSI semantics): `tpch1.customer` works when the pool's database is `acme_tpch` and a grant covers `acme_tpch.tpch1.customer`.

DuckDB's runtime, however, tries a catalog interpretation of the first part first. So when the first part of a two-part name matches a possibly-attached catalog - the tenant-db itself, any federation alias (enabled or disabled), or the DuckDB built-ins `memory` / `system` / `temp` - the engine would bind it catalog-first while the ACL check just resolved it schema-first. Rather than guessing, the validator denies such names as ambiguous:

```
access denied: ambiguous two-part name 'acme_tpch.customer': 'acme_tpch' is an attached catalog; qualify fully as 'acme_tpch.<schema>.<table>'
```

Write the full three-part form (`catalog.schema.table`, e.g. `acme_tpch.tpch1.customer`) to proceed. This denial fails closed and is unconditional: no wildcard grant, including `*.*.* ALL`, admits an ambiguous reference.

After **deleting** a federated source, recycle the pool: running nodes keep the deleted alias attached until they exit, while the ambiguity guard no longer covers it. See [Federation](/qod/operating/federation).

## Revoke access

**Goal:** Remove a user's, group's, or role's access to a pool or table.

**Prerequisites:** The grant you want to remove exists and you know its ID (visible in the UI grant list or from the list endpoint).

**Steps (UI):**

1. Open **Users** and select the tenant.
2. To remove a pool grant: open the user's record in the **Users** tab, find the pool grant row, and click **Remove**.
3. To remove a role from a group: open the **Groups** tab, edit the group, and delete the role assignment.
4. To delete a role permission entirely: open the **Roles** tab, edit the role, and delete the permission row.

**Effect on active sessions:** `invalidateEffectiveCache()` is called on every RBAC mutation in `PoolSupervisor`. This drops the entire in-process EffectiveSet cache immediately, so the revoked grant takes effect on the **next handshake** - there is no TTL window to wait for.

**Manifest (YAML):** Declaratively, remove the entry from its parent's nested list (a `permissions` entry on the role, or a role/group/grant on the user) and re-import; nested collections are replaced to match the file, so the omitted entry is deleted. Top-level roles, groups, and users are upsert-only, so this prunes grants, not whole roles. See [Manage by manifest](/qod/administration/manage-by-manifest).

**CLI equivalent:**

```bash
# Remove a table permission from a role (get <permissionId> from `qod role permission list`)
qod role permission revoke <permissionId>

# Detach a role from a group
qod membership group-role remove --group-id <groupId> --role-id <roleId>

# Remove a user from a group
qod membership user-group remove --user-id <userId> --group-id <groupId>

# Remove pool access from a group (get <id> from `qod pool permission list --tenant acme`)
qod pool permission revoke <id>
```

**Verify:** Re-run the relevant list command and confirm the entry no longer appears:

```bash
# List role permissions
qod role permission list --role-id <roleId>
# List pool permissions
qod pool permission list --tenant acme
```

## Verify access

**Goal:** Confirm that a user sees exactly the rows and columns the policy intends - no more, no less.

**Prerequisites:** `scripts/adbc.sh` is available (ships in the repo). The tenant, pool, and at least one data table exist.

**Steps (CLI - two-realm diff):**

Run the same query twice: once as the tenant user (policy enforced) and once as the bootstrap superuser (policy bypassed). Diff the outputs to see exactly what the ACL, column policy, or row policy filtered or masked.

```bash
# Query as a tenant user (Basic auth + tenant/pool routing headers).
# --insecure trusts the edge's self-signed dev cert.
scripts/adbc.sh --url grpc+tls://localhost:31338 \
  --user alice --password demo-alice \
  --tenant acme --pool bi --insecure \
  --query "SELECT c_mktsegment, count(*) FROM tpch1.customer GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1"

# Same query as the bootstrap superuser (system realm) -- bypasses RLS/CLS,
# so diffing the two outputs shows exactly what a policy filtered or masked.
scripts/adbc.sh --url grpc+tls://localhost:31338 \
  --user root --password demo-root \
  --tenant acme --pool bi --superuser --insecure \
  --query "SELECT c_mktsegment, count(*) FROM tpch1.customer GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1"
```

Note: `scripts/adbc.sh` is a CLI tool, not a REST call. It speaks the FlightSQL wire protocol over gRPC. On first run it provisions an ADBC Python venv under `${QOD_ADBC_VENV:-$HOME/.cache/qod-adbc/venv}`; set `PIP_PROXY` if you are behind a proxy.

**Verify:** The diff between the two outputs should match the intended policy - the tenant user's result should contain only the rows and columns the grant allows. If the outputs are identical, check that `QOD_ACL_ENABLED=true` is set; ACL is off by default.
