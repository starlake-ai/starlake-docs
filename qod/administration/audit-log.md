title: Audit log
---

The manager records a durable, tenant-scoped audit trail of administrative and data-plane activity. When `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=postgres` (the default), every event is written to the `qodstate_audit` table in the control-plane Postgres database. When `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=none`, nothing is recorded and the Audit page is hidden from the navigation.

## What is captured

Events fall into four families:

| Family | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `control-plane` | Mutating REST operations: tenant, database, pool, user, role, group, membership, node, and federation changes |
| `auth` | Login successes, login failures, logouts, session revocations, and rejected API keys |
| `data-denial` | SQL statements blocked by the ACL validator at the FlightSQL edge |
| `data-write` | DDL and DML statements that completed successfully at the FlightSQL edge |

Read statements (`SELECT`, `SHOW`, `EXPLAIN` without DML) are not audited. They belong to statement history, which is a separate subsystem.

### Action taxonomy

The `action` field is a dotted string. The full set of values emitted by the current implementation is:

**Auth**

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `auth.login` | Successful login |
| `auth.login.failure` | Failed login (bad credentials, expired, or unknown user) |
| `auth.logout` | Session logout |
| `auth.revoke` | Explicit session revocation |
| `auth.api-key.failure` | Rejected `X-API-Key` header; rate-limited to one event per source IP per minute |
| `auth.admin.required` | Valid non-admin session denied on an admin endpoint; rate-limited to one event per user per minute |
| `auth.pat.create` | Personal access token minted (target is the token id, detail carries its name) |
| `auth.pat.revoke` | Personal access token revoked (`denied` outcome on an unknown or foreign id) |
| `auth.pat.delete` | Dead (revoked/expired) personal access token removed from the listing (`denied` outcome on a live, unknown, or foreign id) |

**Control-plane: tenants and databases**

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `tenant.create` | Tenant created |

### Each event row

Every row in `qodstate_audit` carries:

| Field | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ts` | ISO-8601 timestamp | Event time |
| `family` | `control-plane`, `auth`, `data-denial`, `data-write` | Coarse grouping |
| `actor` | username | `anonymous` for unauthenticated 401s; `static-key` for API-key callers that cannot be resolved to a user |
| `actor_realm` | `system`, `tenant` | Superuser sessions are `system` |
| `tenant` | tenant id or null | Null for tenant-less events (see below) |
| `action` | dotted verb (see taxonomy above) | |
| `target` | resource identifier or null | Pool key, role id, node id, table name, etc. |
| `outcome` | `ok`, `denied`, `error` | `denied` for scope-gate rejections; `error` for unexpected failures |
| `origin` | `rest`, `flightsql` | Where the event originated |
| `detail` | key-value map | Whitelisted context (see Sanitization) |

## Who sees what

Access to `GET /api/audit/list` follows the same scope rules as every other RBAC read:

- **Superusers** see all rows, including rows where `tenant` is null. The `tenant` filter returns only that tenant's rows (null-tenant rows are not included when a tenant filter is set). Use `noTenant=true` to select only the null-tenant rows.
- **Tenant admins** see only rows whose `tenant` equals one of their administrable tenants. Rows with `tenant IS NULL` are not visible to tenant admins. The `noTenant` parameter is ignored for tenant admins.
- **Static-key callers** are treated as superusers.

Rows with `tenant IS NULL` represent events with no tenant scope: anonymous authentication failures, node operations that span tenants, and manifest imports. These are exclusively visible to superusers so tenant admins cannot infer deployment topology from them.

The tenant admin scope is enforced server-side. A tenant admin requesting `?tenant=other-tenant` gets back their own tenant's rows, not an error, so no cross-tenant existence is leaked via differential error codes.

## Retention

The manager runs an hourly background purge that deletes rows older than `QOD_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `90`). The purge runs hourly and deletes all rows older than the cutoff in one statement.

To keep audit records for a longer period:

```bash
QOD_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=365 qod start
```

To disable retention (keep forever), set `QOD_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=0`. The purge runs but deletes nothing.

In HA mode the hourly purge runs only on the singleton leader (the replica holding the `HaCoordinator` Postgres advisory lock). A failover hands the duty to the next leader on its next tick.

## Sanitization

The `detail` field is built exclusively from whitelisted keys per action. The `AuditEvent` constructor rejects any detail map that contains a key matching `password`, `secret`, `token`, `jwt`, or `credential` (case-insensitive substring match). This is a construction-time guarantee, not a filtering step: no code path can store these values by accident because the constructor throws before any write reaches the store.

Specifically, the following never enter the audit trail:

- Login passwords
- Federation secret values
- Session JWTs
- Full metastore connection maps (which may contain passwords)
- Raw pod template bodies (which may contain paths and credentials)

SQL text in data-plane events (`sql.write`, `sql.ddl`, `sql.denied`) is capped at 500 characters. The text is recorded verbatim; statements that inline credentials (for example `CREATE SECRET`) will persist those literals in the audit trail up to the 500-char cap. The key whitelist described above guards structured `detail` fields only, not SQL text.

## The `none` off switch

Set `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=none` to disable the audit subsystem entirely:

- Every `appendAudit` call is a no-op.
- Every `listAudit` call returns empty.
- The journal fiber, the hourly purge duty, and the rollup duties are not started.
- The `qod_journal_dropped_total` counter stays at zero (not recording is intentional, not a drop).
- The Audit entry is hidden from the admin UI navigation. A deep link to the Audit page shows an empty state with a "telemetry is disabled" message.

The `postgres` and `none` values are the only accepted values for `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE`. Any other value is refused at startup.

## Querying the audit log with the CLI

The examples below use the [qod CLI](/qod/cli/); they assume `qod login` has stored a session, or `QOD_API_KEY` is set for CI scripts.

```bash
# List the 50 most recent control-plane events (default limit)
qod audit list --family control-plane --limit 50

# Page through with the keyset cursor
qod audit list --before <nextBefore-from-previous-page>

# Failed logins in a window
qod audit list --action auth.login.failure --from 2026-07-01T00:00:00Z
```

The exhaustive action vocabulary (for building filter UIs) is served by a static registry:

```bash
qod audit actions
```

### Filter parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `family` | Filter by event family (`control-plane`, `auth`, `data-denial`, `data-write`) |
| `tenant` | Filter by tenant id. Superusers and static-key callers: returns exactly that tenant's rows (null-tenant rows not included). Tenant admins: narrows within their manageable tenants; a tenant outside their set silently falls back to all manageable rows. |
| `noTenant` | Set to `true` to return only rows with no tenant scope (superusers and static-key callers only; ignored for tenant admins). Wins over `tenant` when both are supplied: if `noTenant=true` and `?tenant=x` are both present, only null-tenant rows are returned. |
| `actor` | Filter by actor username (exact match) |
| `action` | Filter by action string (exact match, e.g. `auth.login.failure`) |
| `q` | Substring match on `target` and `action` |
| `from` | ISO-8601 instant; return only events at or after this time |
| `to` | ISO-8601 instant; return only events before this time |
| `limit` | Number of rows to return (default 50, max 500) |
| `before` | Opaque keyset cursor from `nextBefore` in a prior response; used to fetch the next page of older results |

Results are returned newest-first. The response includes a `nextBefore` cursor whenever the page is non-empty; the UI shows a "Load more" button only when the page is full (the `limit` was reached).
