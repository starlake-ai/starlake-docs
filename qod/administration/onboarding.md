This page walks an administrator through the complete golden path: from signing in to the admin console through handing a BI user a ready-to-paste connection string. Each playbook covers the console steps, the equivalent [qod CLI](/qod/cli/) command, and how to confirm success.

## Sign in {#sign-in}

**Goal:** Open the admin console and authenticate in the correct realm.

**Prerequisites:**

- The manager is running and reachable at `http://<host>:20900`.
- You have either superuser credentials (a `qodstate_user` row with `tenant IS NULL`) or tenant-scoped credentials.

**Steps (UI):**

1. Open `http://<host>:20900/ui/` in a browser.
2. Enter your username and password.
3. Leave **Tenant ID** blank to log in as a system superuser. Fill it in (for example, `acme`) to log in as a tenant-scoped user.
4. Click **Sign in**.

![Login screen](/img/ui/login.png)

**CLI equivalent:**

```bash
qod login --url http://localhost:20900 --username admin
```

`qod login` prompts for the password (never a command-line flag), mints a session, and stores it in the active profile - every subsequent `qod` command reuses it. CI scripts can set `QOD_API_KEY` instead of logging in.

**Verify:** The top-right pill shows the signed-in user and their role. In no-auth dev mode the pill reads `anonymous / no-auth`.

## Create a tenant {#create-a-tenant}

**Goal:** Register a new isolated tenant namespace in the control plane.

**Prerequisites:**

- Signed in as a system superuser.

**Steps (UI):**

1. Click **Tenants** in the top navigation bar.
2. Click **New tenant**.
3. Enter a short identifier in the **Name** field (for example, `acme`). The name becomes the routing slug used in connection strings.
4. Click **Create**.

The form does not have a dedicated screenshot; it is a single-field dialog on the Tenants list page.

**Manifest (YAML)**

This is a fragment of the full config manifest; see [Manage by manifest](/qod/administration/manage-by-manifest) to assemble and apply it.

```yaml
tenants:
  - name: acme
    displayName: Acme Corporation
```

**CLI equivalent:**

```bash
qod tenant create acme
```

Metastore settings (database name, schema) are configured per tenant-db, not on the tenant itself - see [Add a database](#add-a-database) below.

**Verify:** The new tenant appears in the Tenants list immediately after creation.

- [Tenancy model](/qod/concepts/tenancy)

---

## Add a database {#add-a-database}

**Goal:** Attach a database (tenant-db) to the tenant so pools have a catalog to connect to.

**Prerequisites:**

- The tenant exists (see [Create a tenant](#create-a-tenant)).
- Signed in as a superuser or as the tenant's admin.
- For `ducklake` kind (the default): the Postgres metastore is reachable and `dataPath` points to writable object storage.

**Steps (UI):**

1. Open the tenant from the Tenants list.
2. Click the **Databases** tab.
3. Click **New database**.
4. Fill in:
   - **Name** - a short identifier for this database (for example, `main`).
   - **Kind** - `ducklake` is the default for production multi-node persistence; `duckdb-file` for a local file; `memory` for federation-only workloads.
   - **Data path** - the object-store URI (for `ducklake`) or file path (for `duckdb-file`); leave blank for `memory`.
   - **Default schema** - the schema presented to clients when none is specified.
5. Click **Create**.

![Databases tab](/img/ui/databases.png)

**Manifest (YAML)**

```yaml
tenants:
  - name: acme
    tenantDbs:
      - name: fed
        kind: memory
        defaultDatabase: fedpg
        defaultSchema: public
```

**CLI equivalent:**

The example below creates an in-memory database. Replace `--kind memory` with `--kind ducklake` (the default) and supply `--data-path` for a production tenant-db.

```bash
qod database create --tenant acme --name fed --kind memory \
  --default-database fedpg --default-schema public
```

**Verify:** The database appears in the Databases tab with its kind and default schema displayed.

## Create and size a pool {#create-and-size-a-pool}

**Goal:** Spin up a pool of Quack nodes bound to a database so clients can connect.

**Prerequisites:**

- The tenant and at least one database exist.
- Signed in as a superuser or the tenant's admin.

**Steps (UI):**

1. Open the tenant from the Tenants list.
2. Click the **Pools** tab.
3. Click **New pool**.
4. Fill in:
   - **Pool name** - a short identifier (for example, `bi`).
   - **Database** - select the database this pool should serve.
   - **Role distribution** - set the counts for Write-only, Read-only, and Dual nodes. The total becomes the pool size.
   - **Create disabled** (optional) - check this to register the pool without immediately spawning nodes.
5. Click **Create**.

![Pools tab](/img/ui/tenant-pools.png)

**Manifest (YAML)**

```yaml
tenants:
  - name: acme
    pools:
      - name: bi
        tenantDb: acme_tpch
        roleDistribution: { writeonly: 1, readonly: 1, dual: 1 }
```

**CLI equivalent:**

```bash
# Create a pool (1 WriteOnly + 1 ReadOnly + 1 Dual = 3 nodes)
qod pool create --tenant acme --db acme_tpch --pool bi --size 3 \
  --writeonly 1 --readonly 1 --dual 1
```

**Verify:** The pool row appears in the Pools tab and the node count starts incrementing as nodes come up. You can watch the progress on the Nodes tab.

- [Routing](/qod/concepts/routing)

## Confirm nodes are live {#confirm-nodes-are-live}

**Goal:** Verify that every expected node is healthy and accepting traffic before handing off the connection string.

**Prerequisites:**

- The pool was created and nodes have had time to initialize (usually a few seconds on a local deployment).

**Steps (UI):**

1. Click **Nodes** in the top navigation bar (or open the tenant and look at its live-node table).
2. Locate the pool's rows in the Nodes table.
3. Check that each node shows **healthy = true** and that the in-flight and total-served counters are updating.

![Nodes overview](/img/ui/nodes.png)

**CLI equivalent:**

```bash
# Live node table (used by the UI)
qod --json pool list | jq -r '.pools[].nodes[] |
  "\(.nodeId) role=\(.role) healthy=\(.healthy) served=\(.totalServed) p50=\(.p50Ms) p95=\(.p95Ms) p99=\(.p99Ms)"'
```

**Verify:** The number of healthy rows for the pool matches the role distribution you configured (write-only + read-only + dual = total size).

## Hand off a connection string {#hand-off-a-connection-string}

**Goal:** Give the BI user or developer a ready-to-paste connection string for their tool.

**Prerequisites:**

- The pool is live and at least one node is healthy (see [Confirm nodes are live](#confirm-nodes-are-live)).
- The end user has credentials for the tenant (see [Access control](/qod/administration/access-control) for how to create user accounts and grants).

**Steps (UI):**

1. Open the tenant from the Tenants list.
2. Click the **Pools** tab, then click the pool name to open its detail page.
3. Click the **Connections** tab.
4. Copy the JDBC, ODBC, or ADBC connection string that matches the client tool.

![Pool Connections tab](/img/ui/pool-connections.png)

**CLI equivalent:** There is no CLI equivalent for this step. The Connections tab is a UI convenience that assembles the string from the pool's host, port, tenant, and pool name. The underlying parameters are available from `qod --json pool list`.

**Verify:** The BI user connects successfully. For client-specific setup steps, see the client guides listed below.

- [Power BI](/qod/connecting/powerbi)
- [Tableau](/qod/connecting/tableau)
