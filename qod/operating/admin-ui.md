title: Admin UI guide
---

The manager serves a React console at `http://<host>:20900/ui/`. Superusers and tenant admins get the full operator console: it manages tenants, databases, pools, users, and access control, and surfaces live node and statement telemetry. Regular (`role=user`) tenant users can log in too, but land on a self-service [Profile page](#profile-page-regular-users) instead of the operator console. Neither view is an end-user query tool; clients run SQL over the FlightSQL edge, not through this UI.

Every screen here is backed by a REST endpoint documented in the [REST API reference](pathname:///api/); the UI is a thin front end over the same `/api/*` calls shown on the operator pages. Where a screen maps to a task already covered in prose, this guide links there rather than repeating it.

The screenshots below are from a local demo deployment with the bootstrap TPC-H tenant.

## Signing in

The login screen takes a username, password, and an optional **Tenant ID**. The tenant field is the realm signal:

- **Leave it blank** to log in as a system superuser. Credentials are validated against the manager's global auth providers (`quack-flightsql.auth.*`) and the matching `qodstate_user` row must have `tenant IS NULL`. This path (and the OIDC single sign-on login) is admin-only.
- **Fill it in** (e.g. `t-02d0e86e`) to log in as a tenant user. Credentials are validated against THAT tenant's configured provider, and the matching `qodstate_user` row must have `tenant = <id>`. A tenant admin lands on the operator console scoped to that tenant; a regular (`role=user`) principal with a database-backed password login lands on the [Profile page](#profile-page-regular-users) instead.

There is no separate superuser checkbox; the field's presence is the only signal. Pre-existing scripts that called `/api/auth/login` with a `tenant` value for the bootstrap admin need to drop the field (or send an empty string) after upgrading.

When the server has no auth providers configured (the no-auth dev mode), the login screen is skipped and the session is a synthetic anonymous superuser. The signed-in user and role appear in the top-right pill; the no-auth mode shows `anonymous / no-auth`.

![The Quack on Demand admin login screen](/img/ui/login.png)

For how credentials are validated and how to wire an external provider, see [Authentication](/qod/operating/authentication) and [Authentication providers](/qod/operating/auth-providers).

## Profile page (regular users)

A tenant-scoped `role=user` principal signing in with a database-backed password login (not OIDC, not the blank/superuser login) lands on a stripped-down `/profile` page instead of the operator console: no Nodes, Tenants, Users, or Audit nav items are even mounted. The page lets them change their own password (username, tenant, and role are read-only) and view their own access statistics - their usage and recent statements, the same data the [Usage](#usage) and [Statements](#statements) pages show an admin, scoped to just that user.

The server enforces this independently of the UI: such a session's REST calls are demoted to a fixed allowlist (`whoami`, `logout`, `/api/profile/usage`, `/api/profile/statements`) and answer `403 admin_required` on everything else, so a deep link to an operator page 403s on its first fetch rather than leaking data. The `qod profile usage` / `qod profile statements` CLI commands hit the same two endpoints.

## Navigation

The top navigation bar has **Nodes**, **Tenants**, **Users**, an **Audit** dropdown menu, and (for a superuser admin only) **Config** last, plus the user pill and Sign out. The Audit menu groups the three telemetry pages: **Control Plane** (the audit log at `/audit`), **Statements** (statement history and trends at `/history`), and **Usage** (the metering ledger at `/usage`). The menu closes on selection, on a click elsewhere, or with Escape, and its trigger stays highlighted while any of the three pages is open.

The Config tab is hidden for non-superusers, and its backend endpoints reject them as well, so a deep link does not leak it. The whole Audit menu is hidden when `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=none`; it is visible to superusers and tenant admins otherwise. Deep links to the three pages keep working regardless (they render a "telemetry is disabled" state when recording is off).

![The top navigation bar](/img/ui/nav.png)

![The Audit dropdown menu open](/img/ui/nav-audit-menu.png)

## Nodes

`Nodes` is the landing page and the at-a-glance operational view. A metrics strip across the top summarizes the deployment: node count, healthy count, statements in flight, QPS (computed client-side from deltas), total served, average latency, worst p95, DuckDB memory in use, and spill volume. A **Tenant filter** dropdown narrows everything on the page to one tenant.

Below the strip, a live table lists every Quack node grouped by tenant and pool: role, status badge (healthy / draining / unhealthy / quarantined), endpoint, in-flight count, total served, average and percentile latency (rolling 256-sample window), DuckDB memory, spill, and a per-node **Max conc.** column. Node ids are links that filter the page to that node. For superusers each row also offers **Quarantine** / **Unquarantine** (stop routing new statements to the node; durable across restarts) and **Restart** (kill and respawn with the same id), both behind confirmation dialogs; the quarantine dialog warns when the node is the pool's last routable one. These are the UI forms of the [incident-response endpoints](/qod/administration/day-2-operations).

A **Running statements** card above the Recent statements table shows active queries with the user, tenant/pool, node, a live elapsed counter, and the SQL; each row has a **Kill** button (best-effort stream close; the card reports when the statement had already completed before the kill arrived).

A **Recent statements** table at the bottom shows the last statements routed through the edge with a status badge (`ok`, `denied`, `transient`, `permanent`, `no-node`, `no-pool`, `pin-lost`, `killed`), duration (with the FlightSQL prepare-probe duration as subtext when the statement was prepared), the node that served it, and the SQL with syntax highlighting and a copy button. The page refreshes every 2 seconds.

![The Nodes overview with live per-node counters](/img/ui/nodes.png)

## Tenants

`Tenants` lists every tenant with an enable/disable toggle per row (the disabled state is the data-plane kill switch: the edge rejects fresh handshakes for a disabled tenant) and offers a **New tenant** form. Selecting a tenant opens its detail page.

The tenant detail page has three tabs:

- **Databases** - create and manage the tenant's databases (tenant-dbs).
- **Pools** - create pools bound to a database and operate them.
- **Auth provider** - the tenant's auth provider and its configuration.

The page also links to the tenant's live nodes and recent statements.

![The tenant detail page on the Pools tab](/img/ui/tenant-pools.png)

### Databases and federation

The **Databases** tab lists the tenant's databases with a kind badge (`ducklake`, `duckdb-file`, or `memory`), schema, and data path (marked `(inherited)` when the manager default applies). The **Tables** count is a link that opens the catalog browser inline, including the database's snapshot history (see [Snapshots and time travel](#snapshots-and-time-travel)); **Federation** (with a badge counting the database's federated sources) opens the federated-source panel. Disabled databases render dimmed with a `(disabled)` marker.

![The Databases tab](/img/ui/databases.png)

Clicking a database name opens its **edit form**: default database and schema, init SQL, and the metastore and object-store maps as `key=value` lines. The kind is immutable. Editing the metastore, object store, or init SQL restarts all the database's nodes immediately (in-flight statements on them fail); the form warns about this, and the save button changes to **Save and restart nodes** when such a field is dirty. `pgPassword` is kept unless a new value is supplied (sending one rotates it). The form also carries the **Delete database** action.

Clicking **Federation** opens the federated-source panel, where DuckDB `ATTACH` / extension catalogs are registered (with their secrets) and injected at session start. See [Federation](/qod/operating/federation).

![The federation panel for a database](/img/ui/federation.png)

### Pools

The **Pools** tab lists each pool with its database, node count, and an enable/disable toggle. Clicking a pool name opens the pool detail inline; the lifecycle actions (Scale, Suspend, Delete) live on the detail page.

The **New pool** form takes the role distribution, optional pool init SQL, optional CPU and memory limits for the pool's node pods (sliders; applied as both request and limit on Kubernetes), a **Create disabled** toggle (nodes spawn, but the edge rejects fresh handshakes until enabled), and the node-placement section described below.

### Pool detail

The pool detail page has tabs for **Nodes**, **Connections**, **Storage**, and **Placement**. Its header carries the pool's lifecycle actions:

- **Scale** opens a modal with the target role distribution (WriteOnly / ReadOnly / Dual counts; the target size is their sum) and, when scaling down, a **Force** checkbox that skips the graceful drain (outstanding queries fail).
- **Suspend** is a menu with three ways to zero nodes: **Hibernate** (nodes stop, the role distribution is kept, and the first query wakes the pool automatically), **Drain** (finish routing, then stop; stays down), and **Kill** (stop immediately; outstanding queries fail; stays down). A hibernated pool shows a **Hibernated** badge and the menu is replaced by a **Wake** button.
- **Delete** (the trash button) removes the pool from the registry after stopping it.
- Superusers also get the pool's **Lockdown** override selector (`inherit | on | off`), described in [Hardening](/qod/operating/hardening).

![The pool Suspend menu with Hibernate, Drain, and Kill](/img/ui/pool-detail-suspend-menu.png)

The **Nodes** tab shows the per-node table with role, host, and port, plus per-pool **CPU limit** and **Memory limit** editors (checkbox + slider, with a **Save** button; a note reminds that node restarts apply resource changes and that sizing is Kubernetes-only) and a per-node **Max concurrent** input (0 = unlimited, saved on blur). Superusers get the same **Quarantine** / **Restart** actions as on the Nodes page.

![The pool detail page on the Nodes tab](/img/ui/pool-detail.png)

The **Connections** tab gives ready-made **JDBC**, **ODBC**, and **ADBC (Python)** connection recipes pre-filled with the pool's `tenant` and `pool` (and `superuser=true` when the operator is a superuser), plus direct per-node `ATTACH` URIs for the DuckDB `quack` extension (see [Connecting clients](/qod/connecting/clients)). The **Storage** tab shows the pool's effective metastore: data path, catalog database, schema, and Postgres endpoint.

![The pool Connections tab with client connection strings](/img/ui/pool-connections.png)

![The pool Storage tab](/img/ui/pool-storage.png)

### Node placement

When you create a pool, the **New pool** form has a **Node placement** section. Enabling "Pin nodes to Kubernetes node labels (cohorts)" opens the cohort editor: per-cohort read-only / write-only / dual counts and a `nodeSelector` of `key=value` Kubernetes node labels, with **+ add cohort** for additional cohorts. On a manager that is not running on Kubernetes, the form shows a warning that placement is saved with the pool (and survives a manifest export to a K8s cluster) but ignored at runtime, where the local backend spawns every node regardless. The pool detail's **Placement** tab renders the persisted plan: per-cohort role counts, `nodeSelector`, and Kubernetes tolerations. The model is described on the [Pools and cohorts](/qod/operating/pools-cohorts) page.

![The New pool form with the cohort placement editor open](/img/ui/placement.png)

### Maintenance

The tenant page's **Maintenance** tab manages [managed DuckLake maintenance](/qod/operating/maintenance) per database. Pick one of the tenant's DuckLake databases to get its panel:

- **Policy form**, bound to the database-level scope: the enable toggle, retention days (annotated as the bound on time-travel, undrop, and history horizons), compaction knobs (target file size, small-file threshold, rewrite threshold), cleanup grace and orphan age, and the cadence cron. Unset fields show the effective defaults as placeholders; the first save creates the policy row.
- **Overrides table** listing schema- and table-scope policy rows with their overriding fields; rows can be deleted here (creating overrides needs the [qod CLI](/qod/cli/) for now: `qod maintenance policy-upsert --scope-kind schema` or `--scope-kind table`).
- **Run history**, newest first with load-more and a **Refresh** button that re-fetches the list: trigger (cadence, threshold, or manual), scope, status (`succeeded` / `failed` / `partial`), per-step counters, bytes reclaimed, and duration.
- **Run maintenance now** under an advanced disclosure, the manual escape hatch. Scope is a select: **whole database (full chain)** or **single table (table-safe steps)**, the latter revealing schema and table inputs. Operations are checkboxes over the chain vocabulary (`flush`, `expire`, `merge`, `rewrite`, `cleanup`, `orphans`); leaving all checked runs the full chain, unchecking restricts the run to the checked subset. It is refused with a conflict while a run is already queued or running for the database.

Maintenance is double-opt-in: the service runs by default but every database starts disabled, and the first enable expires all unpinned snapshots older than the retention window on the next tick. Protect snapshots with tags first (see [Snapshots and time travel](#snapshots-and-time-travel)).

## Users and access control

`Users` is the RBAC console, titled **Users & access control**. A tenant selector at the top scopes the view; besides the concrete tenants it offers two synthetic scopes, **(all)** (every user, superusers included) and **(superusers)** (only rows with `tenant IS NULL`). When a concrete tenant is selected, its configured auth provider and settings are shown next to the selector. Three tabs cover the graph:

- **Users** - create users, set their role, and assign roles, groups, and pool grants.
- **Groups** - define groups and the roles they carry (needs a concrete tenant scope; the tab shows a hint on the synthetic scopes).
- **Roles** - define roles and their table permissions (needs a concrete tenant scope).

The **Users** tab lists each user with their assigned roles, groups, and pool grants.

![The Users tab](/img/ui/rbac-users.png)

The **Groups** tab shows each group with its user, role, and pool-grant counts.

![The Groups tab](/img/ui/rbac-groups.png)

The **Roles** tab lists each role with a per-verb count (RO / RW / DDL / ALL) of its table permissions, and **+ New role** plus per-role edit and delete actions.

![The Roles tab](/img/ui/rbac-roles.png)

The model these screens edit (the EffectiveSet, verbs, wildcards, the two gates) is described in the [Access control model](/qod/operating/rbac-model); the step-by-step grant flows are on the "Administering access" page.

## Catalog browser

The catalog browser lists the schemas and tables of a database (the DuckLake catalog). It is reachable at `/ui/catalog` with tenant and database selectors (both preserved in the URL), and contextually from the table-count links on the Databases tab. Use it to confirm what a pool actually exposes, including federated catalogs attached to the database.

![The catalog browser with a schema's tables listed](/img/ui/catalog.png)

Clicking a table opens its detail page, with breadcrumbs back to the catalog and links to the owning tenant and its live nodes. It shows a summary (row count, data-file count, total parquet size, folder), the column list (name, type, nullability, primary-key flag), and the table's parquet files with per-file size, row count, and snapshot id.

### Snapshots and time travel

Below the table list, a **Snapshots** panel shows the database's DuckLake snapshot history, newest first: snapshot id, commit time, author (the authenticated principal who triggered the change; "unknown" for pre-existing snapshots with no stamp), commit message (the SQL verb or manual description), the raw change summary (`created_table:...`, `inserted_into_table:...`), rows added, files added / removed, and the affected tables. Each affected table links to its detail page as of that snapshot. The panel loads 200 snapshots at a time; **Load older snapshots** fetches the next page (keyset pagination, so new commits do not shift the window while you browse). A **filter box** above the table narrows the timeline to snapshots that touched a specific table by name.

![The snapshots panel with the demo database's history](/img/ui/snapshots.png)

Each snapshot row also carries its **tags**: named handles (chips) you create with the row's **+ tag** button, optionally with a retention hold ("protect this snapshot"). Protected tags show a `hold` badge and pin their snapshot against [maintenance expiry](/qod/operating/maintenance#retention-holds); deleting one asks for confirmation since it releases the pin. A tag whose snapshot has since been expired renders dimmed with a `missing` badge. When holds exist, a summary line above the table counts the pinned snapshots. Tag names are per-database, 1 to 128 characters, and never all digits, so they stay unambiguous next to snapshot ids.

On the table detail page, a **Snapshot** selector switches between the current state and any listed snapshot: the summary, column list, and parquet files re-render as of the chosen snapshot, a banner recalls which snapshot is shown, and **back to current** drops it. The view is addressable directly with the `?asOf=<snapshot id>` query parameter (what the panel's deep links use); the selector lists named tags first, so you can time-travel by name, and API callers can use `?asOfTag=<name>` as an alias (supplying both is rejected). You can also view data as of a specific ISO-8601 timestamp: supply `?asOfTs=<timestamp>` (e.g. `2026-07-09T14:30:00Z`) and the manager resolves it to the nearest snapshot at or before that moment, surfaced in the page banner. Picking a snapshot where the table did not yet exist shows a not-found message while keeping the selector usable, and an unknown snapshot id is a 404 rather than an empty render.

![A table viewed as of a snapshot, with the AS OF banner](/img/ui/catalog-asof.png)

Snapshot semantics (linear history, inlined DML, retention and expiry) are covered in [DuckLake catalogs](/qod/concepts/catalogs#snapshots-and-time-travel).

#### Restore

Both the Snapshots panel and the History tab offer a **Restore** action on a live table: a
**restore** chip next to each affected table in a snapshot row, and a **Restore to this
snapshot** button in the History tab's commit detail drawer. Either entry point opens the same
dialog, which runs a dry run immediately and shows the change summary that will be undone
(rows inserted, deleted, and updated since the target snapshot) before enabling the **Restore**
button; there is no way to write without seeing the preview first.

Restore is non-destructive: it writes the table's state at the target snapshot as a new forward
snapshot rather than rewriting history. The pre-restore state stays queryable by time travel, but
the table gets a new identity, so its History tab timeline restarts at the restore snapshot. If
the table changed between the preview and the confirm click, the execute call gets a 409 and the
dialog re-runs the dry run and asks you to confirm again against the fresh preview, instead of
silently restoring over the intervening write. The same flow is available from the CLI as
`qod catalog restore` (see [Command reference](/qod/cli/reference#catalog)).

#### Row preview

The table detail page carries a **Preview** section that fetches a sample of live rows from the table. The preview executes through the same FlightSQL pipeline as production data traffic: pool access-control lists apply (a user without SELECT on the table is denied), row-level and column-level security policies are enforced, and reads route only to ReadOnly/Dual nodes to avoid load on write-capable pool members. Every preview is recorded in the audit log. The preview is bounded (default 100 rows, configurable via the UI) and labeled with the snapshot it reflects ("current" or the snapshot id) so the operator knows the exact version being examined.

#### Schema diff

The table detail page offers a **Compare** action between any two snapshots: click the snapshot selector's diff icon, pick a second snapshot, and the manager computes a schema diff showing added columns, removed columns, columns that changed type, and columns whose nullability changed. Columns that were renamed are disambiguated by table identity and sequence order rather than name matching, so a rename is correctly surfaced as a remove + add rather than a false "no change." Diff results include deep links back to both the source and target snapshots for context, and you can re-run the diff by modifying the `?from=<snapshot-id-or-tag>&to=<snapshot-id-or-tag>` query parameters.

#### History

The table detail page also carries a **History** tab: a filterable, newest-first timeline of the table's own DuckLake commits, distinct from the database-wide Snapshots panel above. Each row shows the commit time, an operation badge (create, insert, delete, update, alter, drop, maintenance, or unknown), the author and commit message, the row delta, and whether the commit changed the schema; filters above the table narrow by time range, operation, and author, and **Load more** pages the timeline with keyset pagination so new commits do not shift the window while you browse. Row and file deltas are computed from live DuckLake catalog metadata, so they are best-effort for older commits once maintenance has run: file-cleanup consumes the bookkeeping behind `filesRemoved`, and adjacent-file compaction can drop the `rowsAdded`/`filesAdded` of the insert commits it superseded. Clicking a row opens a detail drawer with the full snapshot id, schema version, and file counts, plus two deep links: **View table at this snapshot** jumps to the AS OF view covered above, and **Compare schema** loads the schema diff for this commit and the one before it and pre-fills the Compare tab's pickers and `?diffFrom`/`?diffTo` URL params in the background; open the **Compare** tab to see the result. History survives table renames because it keys on the table's stable identity rather than its name. Null authors (commits made before author stamping was enabled) render as "unknown", matching the Snapshots panel.

## Control Plane

The **Control Plane** page (`/audit`, the first entry of the Audit menu) shows a tenant-scoped, newest-first table of administrative and data-plane events. It is available to superusers and tenant admins. When `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=none`, a deep link shows an empty state with a "telemetry is disabled" message.

The page has a filter bar with:

- **Family** - dropdown select for `control-plane`, `auth`, `data-denial`, and `data-write`.
- **Tenant** - a select populated from the live tenant list, visible to superusers only. Includes a "(no tenant)" option to show only tenant-less events (anonymous authentication failures, node operations, and manifest imports). Tenant admins are pinned to their own tenant and do not see this filter.
- **Actor** - filter by username.
- **Action** - a select populated from the exhaustive action vocabulary served by `GET /api/audit/actions`.
- **Time range** - from / to fields.

The event table shows timestamp, family badge, actor (with a `(system)` marker for system-realm actors), action, target, tenant, and an outcome badge (`ok`, `denied`, `error`). Each row is expandable to reveal the `detail` key-value map as a formatted list.

Pagination uses a keyset "Load more" button rather than numbered pages. There is no live polling; audit is a forensic view, so a manual **Refresh** button is provided.

![The Control Plane audit table](/img/ui/control-plane.png)

The four event families, the full action taxonomy, tenant scoping rules, retention, and the sanitization guarantee are documented on the [Audit log](/qod/administration/audit-log) page.

## Statements

The **Statements** page (`/history`, the second entry of the Audit menu) gives a time-series view of FlightSQL activity. It is available to superusers and tenant admins; with `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=none` a deep link shows the "telemetry is disabled" state.

A range picker (1h / 24h / 7d / 30d) sets the window shared by the charts and the statement table; ranges up to 48 hours use hourly buckets, wider ranges use daily buckets automatically. Next to it sit a tenant select (superusers only) and a pool select whose options narrow to the chosen tenant; changing a selection reloads immediately.

The three charts are:

- **Throughput** - stacked ok / denied / error statement counts per bucket.
- **Error rate** - percentage of statements per bucket that were denied or failed (transient, permanent, no-node, no-pool, or pin-lost).
- **Latency percentiles** - p50, p95, and p99 as separate lines. Percentiles come from the hourly rollup; at daily granularity the chart is replaced by a note that percentiles are available at hourly granularity.

Below the charts, a searchable statement table shows the raw rows for the selected window: timestamp, user, pool, status badge, duration (with the prepare-probe duration as subtext when present), and a truncated SQL preview. Clicking a row expands the full SQL (up to the 500-character recording cap) with syntax highlighting, plus the error text if any. The filter bar above the table takes a user filter, a status select (`ok` through `pin-lost`), and a free-text SQL substring search, applied on **Refresh** rather than per keystroke. Pagination uses a keyset "Load more" button.

![The Statements page with trend charts](/img/ui/statements.png)

The storage model, watermark semantics, retention knobs, and the CLI recipes for both endpoints are covered on the [Statement history and trends](/qod/operating/history-trends) page.

## Usage

The **Usage** page (`/usage`, the third entry of the Audit menu) is the durable metering ledger for FlightSQL activity, aggregated per tenant, pool, or user. It is available to superusers and tenant admins; with `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=none` a deep link shows the "telemetry is disabled" state. A note at the top states the metering unit's caveats (engine-ms is manager-measured execution time, the current day trails by up to one rollup tick, and accounting is best-effort measurement).

The page has a filter bar at the top with:

- **Period picker** - a month input (defaults to the current calendar month) or a custom date range, toggled by the "custom range" button. Custom ranges translate to a half-open `[from, to)` interval in UTC before being sent to the API.
- **Group-by selector** - `by tenant` (superusers only), `by pool`, or `by user`. Tenant admins land on the `by pool` grouping; the `by tenant` option is hidden for them because the API pins them to their own tenant.
- **Metric toggle** - `statements` (total statement count) or `engine-ms` (summed execution time in milliseconds). Switching updates the chart; the totals table always shows all four measures.
- **Tenant and pool filters** - the tenant filter (visible to superusers only) is a select populated from the live tenant list; the pool select narrows its options to the chosen tenant.

Below the filters, a stacked per-day bar chart shows each group's contribution over the period. The top 8 groups by `engineMs` receive distinct colors; all remaining groups are merged into a single gray "other" segment. Periods with no activity show an empty chart.

Below the chart, a totals table shows one row per group, sorted by `engineMs` descending, with columns for tenant, pool (when `groupBy=pool`), user (when `groupBy=user`), statements, errors, denied, and engine-ms. A **Download CSV** button above the table produces a client-side CSV using the column contract described on the [Usage and accounting](/qod/administration/usage-accounting) page.

The `dataStart` field in the API response drives a notice below the filter bar when the requested period starts before the retention horizon: "Data starts YYYY-MM-DD (older buckets purged)."

![The Usage metering page grouped by tenant](/img/ui/usage.png)

The full API reference, CSV column contract, retention knob, and scoping rules are documented on the [Usage and accounting](/qod/administration/usage-accounting) page.

## Config (superuser only)

`Config` is a cross-tenant view of the whole deployment, so it is restricted to a superuser admin. It has two parts:

- **Configuration** - the resolved `application.conf` rendered as a table of each key, its `QOD_*` env var, description, and effective value, grouped by HOCON path section with a filter box that searches paths, env vars, and descriptions. Sensitive values are masked as `(set)` or `(unset)`. This is the live equivalent of the [Configuration reference](/qod/reference/configuration).
- **Manifest** - export the entire control-plane configuration as YAML (**Download YAML**) and re-import an edited file via a drag-and-drop dropzone with an explicit **Apply** step; a summary grid reports what the import touched (tenants, tenant-dbs, pools, roles, groups, users). The semantics, redaction, and apply rules are on the [Manifest backup and restore](/qod/operating/manifest) page.

![The Config page resolved-configuration table](/img/ui/config.png)
