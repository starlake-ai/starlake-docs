The manager collects metrics through Micrometer and routes them to exactly one sink per process. The sink is selected by `quack-on-demand.metrics.sink` (`QOD_METRICS_SINK`), one of `prometheus`, `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`, or `none`. For the full list of emitted series and their labels, see the [Metrics reference](/qod/reference/metrics).

## Prometheus pull (the default)

With `sink = prometheus` (the default) the manager exposes an unauthenticated scrape endpoint, same policy as `/health`:

```
GET http://<host>:20900/metrics
```

A minimal scrape config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: quack-on-demand
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['quack-manager.svc:20900']
    metrics_path: /metrics
```

### Local stack via the observability profile

The compose stack bundles Prometheus and Grafana behind the `observability` profile. Bring up the manager, Postgres, Prometheus, and Grafana in one command, with demo data seeded so the dashboard has live data:

```bash
LOAD_TPC=1 PROFILES=observability ./scripts/run-docker-compose.sh

# Clean slate
NUKE=1 LOAD_TPC=1 PROFILES=observability ./scripts/run-docker-compose.sh
```

Prometheus scrapes the manager container directly over the compose network. Grafana is preprovisioned with the Prometheus datasource and the bundled dashboard, so it renders without manual setup. The boot output prints the URLs:

```text
Manager UI:    http://localhost:20900/ui/       (admin / admin)
Prometheus:    http://localhost:9090            (try query: up)
Grafana:       http://localhost:3000            (anonymous admin; no login)
               Dashboard: "QoD - Single Node"
```

Grafana runs anonymous-admin for zero-login local use; do not expose port 3000 to a public network without disabling that. See the [Docker deployment](/qod/operating/deploy-docker) page for the profile mechanics. Tear down with `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile observability down`.

### Standalone Prometheus + Grafana

When the manager runs outside compose (for example in Kubernetes, reached by `kubectl port-forward`), bring up only the observability containers from the `observability/` directory, which scrape the manager via `host.docker.internal:20900`:

```bash
kubectl -n qod port-forward svc/qod-quack-on-demand 20900:20900 &
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The preprovisioning (datasource UID, auto-loaded dashboard) is identical to the integrated path.

## Cloud push (`aws` / `azure` / `gcp`)

When a cloud sink is selected the manager pushes metrics on a fixed cadence (default 60s) via the cloud SDK, and the `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint is **not** exposed.

| Sink | Select with | Required config | Credentials |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aws` | `QOD_METRICS_SINK=aws` | `QOD_METRICS_AWS_NAMESPACE` (default `quack-on-demand`) | `DefaultCredentialsProvider` chain (IAM role, env, profile) |
| `azure` | `QOD_METRICS_SINK=azure` | `QOD_METRICS_AZURE_KEY` (Application Insights key, required) | `DefaultAzureCredential` (managed identity, env, CLI) |
| `gcp` | `QOD_METRICS_SINK=gcp` | `QOD_METRICS_GCP_PROJECT_ID` (required) | ADC (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, GCE metadata, gcloud) |

Override the cadence with `QOD_METRICS_AWS_STEP_SEC` / `QOD_METRICS_AZURE_STEP_SEC` / `QOD_METRICS_GCP_STEP_SEC`.

**Only one sink runs per process.** There are no per-backend enable flags; the single `sink` field is the sole selector. Selecting a cloud sink means `/metrics` is unavailable and no other sink is active.

## Audit journal health

The event journal that feeds the audit subsystem exposes one counter:

| Metric | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `qod_journal_dropped_total` | `table` | Number of events dropped because the bounded journal queue was full, or because an append to the store failed |

A non-zero value means the affected telemetry table undercounts by that amount. The `table` label identifies which table was affected: `table="audit"` means missed audit events; `table="stmt_history"` means missed statement rows, which in turn causes undercounted hourly rollup buckets and gaps in the History charts. Under sustained overload the data-plane audit trail degrades before the data path does, by design: `offer` is non-blocking and the hot path never waits on Postgres.

When this counter climbs, check Postgres write latency and the journal queue depth. If the rate is low and intermittent it indicates short Postgres blips; if it is sustained, consider scaling Postgres or reducing data-plane statement throughput. The journal queue depth is configured by `QOD_TELEMETRY_JOURNAL_CAPACITY` (default `8192`): the bounded in-process telemetry journal capacity; overflow drops events and increments `qod_journal_dropped_total`. Increase this value to buffer higher data-plane statement throughput under temporary Postgres write latency spikes; this trades memory for durability.

The counter stays at zero when `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=none` because not recording is intentional, not a drop.

## Metrics vs. the usage ledger

`statements_total` and `statement_duration_seconds` (both tagged `tenant`, `pool`, `status`) are the real-time, in-process view of statement activity: they increment on every completed statement and are exported at the Prometheus scrape interval or cloud-push cadence. They answer questions like "what is the current QPS per tenant?" but do not persist across process restarts.

The [Usage page](/qod/administration/usage-accounting) and `GET /api/usage` are the durable ledger view of the same quantities. They are backed by the daily rollup store in Postgres, retained for `QOD_USAGE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 400 days), and are the right integration surface for monthly billing exports and capacity planning over longer windows. The `qod_journal_dropped_total{table="stmt_history"}` counter bridges the two views: a non-zero value means the usage ledger undercounts by that amount for the affected period.

## Common labels

Attach static labels to every series to distinguish environments in a shared Grafana:

| Variable | HOCON key | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `QOD_METRICS_DEPLOYMENT` | `metrics.commonTags.deployment` | Deployment name, e.g. `prod-eu` |
| `QOD_METRICS_REGION` | `metrics.commonTags.region` | Cloud region, e.g. `eu-west-1` |

## Disabling metrics

Set `QOD_METRICS_SINK=none`: no `/metrics` endpoint is mounted, no cloud push occurs, and all counters, timers, and gauges become no-ops.

## The bundled Grafana dashboards

Two deployment-shaped dashboards ship under `observability/`, both ready to import (Grafana 10.x: **Dashboards → New → Import → Upload JSON file**, then pick your Prometheus datasource; the `${datasource}` variable resolves to its UID):

- **`grafana-dashboard-single.json`** ("QoD - Single Node") - for the single-box docker-compose stack. Mounted by the top-level `docker-compose.yml` observability profile.
- **`grafana-dashboard-k8s.json`** ("QoD - Kubernetes") - the single-node content plus the Pool Occupancy, Node Health, and Routing Locality rows. Mounted by the standalone `observability/docker-compose.yml` and rebuilt into the kind smoke rig's ConfigMap.

Rows common to both, top to bottom:

| Row | Panels |
|---|---|
| Overview | Total QPS, error rate, active sessions, sessions in transaction, total nodes |
| Latency | p50 / p95 / p99 statement-duration percentiles |
| By Tenant | Stacked QPS per tenant, outcomes by status |
| DuckDB Engine | Memory used, spill bytes, spill files, temp storage per node |
| DuckLake Maintenance | Runs by result, duration percentiles, files compacted, bytes reclaimed, snapshots expired |
| Security Rewrites | Column- / row-policy rewrites by outcome, rewrite duration means, catalog lookups by result |
| JVM | Heap used, GC pause rate, live threads, process uptime |

Kubernetes-only rows (in `grafana-dashboard-k8s.json`):

| Row | Panels |
|---|---|
| Pool Occupancy | Node count by tenant / pool / role |
| Node Health | Per-node table: healthy, draining, in-flight, EWMA latency |
| Routing Locality | Table repeat rate, placement switch (scatter) rate, placement decisions by outcome, load ratio |

The metric names and labels these panels query are listed in the [Metrics reference](/qod/reference/metrics). For the `QOD_METRICS_*` configuration keys, see the [Configuration reference](/qod/reference/configuration).
