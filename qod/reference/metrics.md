title: Metrics
---

The manager registers these series through Micrometer. They are emitted to whichever sink is active (`QOD_METRICS_SINK`); under the default Prometheus sink they appear at `GET :20900/metrics`. For how to scrape, push to a cloud monitor, or import the Grafana dashboard, see [Observability](/qod/operating/observability).

## Application metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `statements_total` | counter | `tenant`, `pool`, `status` | Statements executed, partitioned by outcome status. Drives QPS and error-rate panels. |
| `statement_duration_seconds` | histogram | `tenant`, `pool` | Statement execution latency; the source of the p50/p95/p99 percentiles. |
| `flightsql_sessions_active` | gauge | (none) | Currently open FlightSQL sessions. |
| `pool_nodes` | gauge | `tenant`, `pool`, `role` | Node count per pool, broken down by node role. |
| `node_healthy` | gauge | `tenant`, `pool`, `node_id`, `role` | 1 when the node is healthy, 0 otherwise. |
| `node_draining` | gauge | `tenant`, `pool`, `node_id`, `role` | 1 when the node is draining in-flight work before shutdown. |
| `node_in_flight` | gauge | `tenant`, `pool`, `node_id`, `role` | Statements currently executing on the node. |
| `node_ewma_latency_seconds` | gauge | `tenant`, `pool`, `node_id`, `role` | EWMA of completed-statement latency, the signal the router uses to pick the least-loaded node. |

## Routing metrics

Emitted per routed statement by the [cache-aware placement](/qod/concepts/routing) layer. The locality series (`routing_tables_total`, `routing_placements_total`) run on any routing policy and stay populated even with `QOD_ROUTING_CACHE_AWARE=false`; the decision and load series describe placement outcomes.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `routing_tables_total` | counter | `tenant`, `pool`, `result` | Table references seen, split into `new` (first time this table is routed) and `repeat` (seen before). A low repeat rate means locality has little to exploit. |
| `routing_placements_total` | counter | `tenant`, `pool`, `result` | Repeat-table routings by whether the table `stay`ed on its last node or `switch`ed to another. The switch rate is the locality-loss (scatter) signal: high means placement is being destroyed. |
| `routing_decisions_total` | counter | `tenant`, `pool`, `outcome` | Placement decisions by outcome: `claim`, `sticky-fresh`, `sticky-stale`, `overflow-new-home`, `overflow-evict-home`, `pinned-sticky`, `pinned-move`, `no-refs-fallback`, `not-eligible`, `flag-off`. Frequent `overflow-evict-home` on a pool means three homes are not enough for its hottest tables. `pinned-sticky` / `pinned-move` mark statements a transaction pin or soft preferredNode placed rather than the scorer, so they are excluded from the overflow signal. |
| `routing_load_ratio` | summary | `tenant`, `pool` | Chosen-node in-flight count over the pool average. Should stay under `routing.loadCapFactor`; a sustained excess means the load cap is not binding. |

## Maintenance metrics

Emitted per finished [managed-maintenance](/qod/operating/maintenance) run. These series carry the `qod_` prefix; the legacy series above predate the prefix convention.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qod_maint_runs_total` | counter | `tenant`, `tenant_db`, `result` | Maintenance runs by outcome (`succeeded`, `failed`, `partial`). A rising `partial` count usually means the pinned-file guard is firing. |
| `qod_maint_bytes_reclaimed_total` | counter | `tenant`, `tenant_db` | Catalog bytes released by runs (physical deletion lags by the cleanup grace window). |
| `qod_maint_files_compacted_total` | counter | `tenant`, `tenant_db` | Files touched by the merge and rewrite steps. |
| `qod_maint_snapshots_expired_total` | counter | `tenant`, `tenant_db` | Snapshots expired (pinned snapshots are skipped, never counted here). |
| `qod_maint_duration_seconds` | timer | `tenant`, `tenant_db` | End-to-end run duration, including maintenance-node spawn time. |

## DuckDB engine metrics

Scraped from each node's DuckDB engine (`duckdb_memory()`, `duckdb_temporary_files()`) by the background health probe, one extra round-trip per node per `QOD_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC` tick. A node that has never been scraped successfully publishes no row (rather than a misleading zero); a failed scrape keeps the previous sample until the next tick.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `node_duckdb_memory_used_bytes` | gauge | `tenant`, `pool`, `node_id`, `role` | Buffer-manager memory in use, summed across all consumers (base tables, hash tables, parquet readers, ...). Compare against the node's `memory_limit` to spot memory pressure before latency degrades. |
| `node_duckdb_temp_storage_bytes` | gauge | `tenant`, `pool`, `node_id`, `role` | Bytes the buffer manager has moved to temporary storage. |
| `node_duckdb_spill_files` | gauge | `tenant`, `pool`, `node_id`, `role` | Live spill-to-disk files. Non-zero means queries are exceeding the memory budget and spilling. |
| `node_duckdb_spill_bytes` | gauge | `tenant`, `pool`, `node_id`, `role` | Total size of live spill files. |

## JVM and process metrics

Registered by the Micrometer JVM and process binders:

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `jvm_memory_used_bytes` | gauge | Heap and non-heap memory in use. |
| `jvm_gc_pause_seconds_sum` | counter | Cumulative GC pause time. |
| `jvm_threads_live_threads` | gauge | Live thread count. |
| `process_uptime_seconds` | gauge | Process uptime since manager start. |

## Common labels

Every series can carry static deployment labels when these are set, useful for separating environments in a shared Grafana:

| Variable | Label | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `QOD_METRICS_DEPLOYMENT` | `deployment` | `prod-eu` |
| `QOD_METRICS_REGION` | `region` | `eu-west-1` |
