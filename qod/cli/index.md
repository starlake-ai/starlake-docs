title: The qod CLI
---

`qod` is a single command-line client for both planes of quack-on-demand: the manager's admin REST surface on `:20900` (tenants, databases, pools, nodes, RBAC, catalog, federation, audit, usage) and the FlightSQL query plane on `:31338` (`qod sql`, one-shot or interactive). Every REST path has a matching noun-verb command - `POST /api/tenant/create` is `qod tenant create`, `GET /api/pool/list` is `qod pool list`, and so on - so if you know the API you already know most of the CLI.

It is also the launcher: `qod start --demo` runs the self-contained demo, and `qod start` / `qod stop` run a real manager against your own Postgres - see [Installation](/qod/getting-started/install) and the [manager jar reference](/qod/reference/cli).

## Install

```bash
pip install qod
```

The CLI is released on PyPI as `qod` (with `qod-cli` kept as a compatibility alias) on the same version number as the manager itself, so pin the CLI to the manager you are talking to. Requires Python 3.10 or later.

To install from a source checkout instead (for example while developing the CLI itself):

```bash
pip install ./cli
```

Both routes install the `qod` console script on `$PATH`.

**Windows.** The same `pip install qod` installs a `qod.exe` entry point; there is no separate Windows package. The profile file lives at `%APPDATA%\qod\config.toml` instead of the Linux/macOS XDG path, and the interactive `qod sql` REPL gets line editing and history from `pyreadline3` (installed automatically as a Windows-only dependency).

## Login and profiles

```bash
qod login --url http://localhost:20900 --username admin
```

Against the demo bootstrap this prompts for the `admin` / `admin` dev password (the password is always a prompt, never a flag, so it never lands in shell history). A successful login mints a session and writes it to the active profile together with the FlightSQL edge settings the manager reports back (host, port, TLS) - one `qod login` configures both the REST plane and the SQL plane in one shot.

Profiles are named sections of a TOML file at a platform config directory: `~/.config/qod/config.toml` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/qod/config.toml` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\qod\config.toml` on Windows (override the whole path with `QOD_CONFIG_FILE`). The file is written with mode `0600` because it can hold a session token and, opt-in, a SQL password. The default profile is named `default`; switch profiles with `--profile prod` (a top-level flag, before the noun) or the `QOD_PROFILE` environment variable, so one machine can hold a `default` profile against a local dev manager and a `prod` profile against a real deployment without either clobbering the other.

For non-interactive callers such as CI, skip `qod login` entirely and set `QOD_API_KEY` to the manager's static REST key - every command resolves credentials the same way, so a static key works everywhere a session token would.

## Settings resolution

Every setting resolves in this order, highest priority first:

1. Command-line flag (`--tenant`, `--url`, ...)
2. `QOD_*` environment variable
3. Value saved in the active profile
4. Built-in default

| Setting | Env var | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `manager_url` | `QOD_MANAGER_URL` | REST plane base URL. |
| `api_key` | `QOD_API_KEY` | Static API key; wins over `token` when both are set. |
| `token` | `QOD_TOKEN` | Session JWT, normally written by `qod login`, not set by hand. |
| `edge_host` | `QOD_HOST` | FlightSQL edge host. |
| `edge_port` | `QOD_PORT` | FlightSQL edge port. |
| `edge_tls` | `QOD_TLS` | TLS to the edge. |
| `edge_tls_verify` | `QOD_TLS_VERIFY` | Verify the edge TLS cert; off by default since the edge ships a self-signed cert. |
| `tenant` | `QOD_TENANT` | Default tenant for `qod sql`. |
| `pool` | `QOD_POOL` | Default pool for `qod sql`. |
| `sql_user` | `QOD_USER` | FlightSQL username; set by `qod login`. |
| `sql_password` | `QOD_PASSWORD` | FlightSQL password; opt-in storage, prompted when unset. |
| `superuser` | `QOD_SUPERUSER` | Send the superuser call header on `qod sql`. |

## Output

Rich tables are the default, sized to the terminal. Pass `--json` - a top-level flag, before the noun - for the raw JSON response body, the stable interface for scripting:

```bash
qod --json tenant list | jq -r '.[].id'
```

`qod sql` additionally supports `--csv` for spreadsheet-friendly output. Exit codes follow the Unix convention: `0` success, `1` a server or API error (the server's error body is printed verbatim, e.g. `tenant_forbidden`), `2` a usage error (missing or invalid arguments).
