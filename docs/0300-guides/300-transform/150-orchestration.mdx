# Orchestrate Transform Jobs

Starlake automatically resolves dependencies between your SQL transforms and generates execution DAGs for your orchestrator.

## How Dependency Resolution Works

Starlake analyzes the `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses in your SQL transforms to build a dependency graph. This graph determines the execution order so that upstream tables are always computed before downstream ones.

## Generate DAGs for Transform

```bash
starlake dag-generate
```

The generated DAGs include both load and transform jobs in the correct execution order.

## Next Steps

- See the [Orchestration Tutorial](/docs/guides/orchestrate/tutorial) for a complete walkthrough.
- See [Customizing DAG Generation](/docs/guides/orchestrate/customization) for per-orchestrator configuration.
