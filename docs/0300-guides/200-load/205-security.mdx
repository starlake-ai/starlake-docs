# Access control



## Table Level Security
Security on a table is defined by the ACL section of the table definition. The ACL section defines the role and the grants for the role. The role is the permission that is granted to the grants. The grants can be users, groups or service accounts.

Below is an example of the ACL section of a table definition.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


<Tabs>

<TabItem value="bigquery" label="BigQuery">

BigQuery Example

```yaml {3-8}
table:
    ...
    acl:
        - role: role/bigQueryViewer
          grants:
            - user:user@starlake.ai
            - group:goup@starlake.ai
            - serviceAccount:service@gserviceaccount.google.com
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="spark" label="Spark">

```yaml{3-8}
table:
    ...
    acl:
        - role: SELECT
          grants:
            - user@starlake.ai
            - group
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Row Level Security

You may also want to restrict access to specific rows in a table.
This is done by defining a row level security policy.
The policy is defined by a SQL expression that is evaluated for each row in the table.
If the expression evaluates to true, the row is returned. If the expression evaluates to false, the row is not returned.

Below is an example of a row level security policy.

```yaml
table:
    ...
    acl:
        - role: SELECT
          grants:
            - user@starlake.ai
            - group
    rls:
      - name: "USA only"
        predicate: "country = 'USA'"
        grants:
          - "group:mygroup"
```


## Column Level Security

You may also want to restrict access to specific columns in a table.

This is done by defining a column level security policy.

This feature is supported on BigQuery only and makes use of access policies to restrict access to specific columns in a table.

Below is an example of a column level security policy.

```yaml
table:
    ...
    acl:
        - role: SELECT
          grants:
            - user@starlake.ai
            - group
    rls:
      - name: "USA only"
        predicate: "country = 'USA'"
        grants:
          - "group:mygroup"
    attributes:
        - name: "code0"
          accessPolicy: PII
          type: "string"
    ...
```
