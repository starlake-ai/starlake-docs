# Orchestrate Load Jobs

Starlake automatically generates orchestration DAGs from your YAML load and transform definitions. Supported orchestrators include Airflow, Dagster and Snowflake Tasks. The `starlake dag-generate` command analyzes job dependencies and produces ready-to-deploy DAG files.

Once your load configurations are ready, Starlake can generate orchestration DAGs automatically based on your YAML definitions.

## Generate DAGs for Load

Run the following command to generate DAGs that include your load jobs:

```bash
starlake dag-generate
```

This analyzes dependencies between your load and transform jobs and produces DAG files for your orchestrator.

## Next Steps

- See the [Orchestration Tutorial](/docs/guides/orchestrate/tutorial) for a complete walkthrough of DAG generation and deployment.
- See [Customizing DAG Generation](/docs/guides/orchestrate/customization) for advanced configuration per orchestrator (Airflow, Dagster, Snowflake Tasks).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I generate DAGs for load jobs in Starlake?
Run the `starlake dag-generate` command. It analyzes dependencies between load and transform jobs and produces DAG files for the configured orchestrator.

### Which orchestrators does Starlake support for load jobs?
Starlake supports Airflow, Dagster and Snowflake Tasks for load job orchestration.

### Do I need to write Airflow DAGs manually for Starlake?
No. The `starlake dag-generate` command automatically generates DAGs from the YAML definitions in your project.

### Are dependencies between load and transform jobs handled automatically?
Yes. DAG generation analyzes the dependencies declared in YAML files and produces a correct execution graph.

### Where can I find the full orchestration documentation for Starlake?
In the [Orchestration Tutorial](/docs/guides/orchestrate/tutorial) and [DAG Customization](/docs/guides/orchestrate/customization) pages.
