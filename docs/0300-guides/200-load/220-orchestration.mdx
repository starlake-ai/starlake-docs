# Orchestrate Load Jobs

Starlake generates orchestration DAGs automatically from your YAML load and transform definitions. You do not write DAG code manually. The `starlake dag-generate` command analyzes job dependencies and produces ready-to-deploy DAG files for your orchestrator.

Supported orchestrators:
- **Airflow** -- Generates Python DAG files.
- **Dagster** -- Generates Dagster job definitions.
- **Snowflake Tasks** -- Generates Snowflake Task definitions.

## Why automatic DAG generation matters

In a traditional data pipeline, you must write and maintain orchestration code alongside your data logic. Starlake eliminates this duplication: your YAML definitions already declare the tables, domains and dependencies. The `dag-generate` command derives the execution graph from these declarations.

This means:
- Zero DAG code to write or maintain.
- Dependencies between load and transform jobs are resolved automatically.
- Adding a new table or domain updates the DAG on the next generation.

## How to generate and deploy DAGs

1. **Ensure all YAML configurations are complete** -- Table, domain and transform definitions must be in place.
2. **Run the generation command:**

```bash
starlake dag-generate
```

3. **Deploy the generated files** -- Copy the output to your Airflow DAGs folder, Dagster repository or Snowflake Tasks environment.

The command analyzes dependencies between your load and transform jobs and produces the correct execution order.

## Next Steps

- See the [Orchestration Tutorial](/docs/guides/orchestrate/tutorial) for a complete walkthrough of DAG generation and deployment.
- See [Customizing DAG Generation](/docs/guides/orchestrate/customization) for advanced configuration per orchestrator (Airflow, Dagster, Snowflake Tasks).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I generate DAGs for load jobs in Starlake?
Run the `starlake dag-generate` command. It analyzes dependencies between load and transform jobs and produces DAG files for the configured orchestrator.

### Which orchestrators does Starlake support for load jobs?
Starlake supports Airflow, Dagster and Snowflake Tasks for load job orchestration.

### Do I need to write Airflow DAGs manually for Starlake?
No. The `starlake dag-generate` command automatically generates DAGs from the YAML definitions in your project.

### Are dependencies between load and transform jobs handled automatically?
Yes. DAG generation analyzes the dependencies declared in YAML files and produces a correct execution graph.

### Where can I find the full orchestration documentation for Starlake?
In the [Orchestration Tutorial](/docs/guides/orchestrate/tutorial) and [DAG Customization](/docs/guides/orchestrate/customization) pages.
