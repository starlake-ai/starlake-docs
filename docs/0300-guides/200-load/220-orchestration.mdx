# Orchestrate Load Jobs

Once your load configurations are ready, Starlake can generate orchestration DAGs automatically based on your YAML definitions.

## Generate DAGs for Load

Run the following command to generate DAGs that include your load jobs:

```bash
starlake dag-generate
```

This analyzes dependencies between your load and transform jobs and produces DAG files for your orchestrator.

## Next Steps

- See the [Orchestration Tutorial](/docs/guides/orchestrate/tutorial) for a complete walkthrough of DAG generation and deployment.
- See [Customizing DAG Generation](/docs/guides/orchestrate/customization) for advanced configuration per orchestrator (Airflow, Dagster, Snowflake Tasks).
