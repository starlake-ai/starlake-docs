# Native load

When loading files into your datawarehouse, starlake uses Spark for advanced data validation and
then uses you datawarehouse's engine to append or overwrite the data.

This is done to ensure that the data is fully validated and  is loaded in the most efficient way possible.

Sometimes you may want to load the data without running any validation checks. This can be done using the `native` load mode.

You may instruct to use the native loader only for a table, a domain or for the entire project.

## Table level

In the table definition, you can specify the load mode as `native` as follows:

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml"
table:
  metadata:
    ...
    loader: native
    ...
  attributes:
  ...
```

In this case, the table will be loaded using the native loader.

## Domain level

In the domain definition, you can specify the load mode as `native` as follows:

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/_config.sl.yml"
load:
  metadata:
    ...
    loader: native
    ...
  tables:
  ...
```
In this case, all the tables in the domain will be loaded using the native loader if not otherwise specified at the table level.

## Project level

In the project definition, you can specify the load mode as `native` as follows:

```yaml title="metadata/load/application.sl.yml"
application:
  ...
  loader: native
  ...
```

In this case, all the tables in the project will be loaded using the native loader if not otherwise specified at the domain or table level.
