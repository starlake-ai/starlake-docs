# Native load

Native load mode bypasses the Spark validation layer and sends files directly to the data warehouse engine (BigQuery, Snowflake or Databricks). This improves ingestion speed when type validation and attribute scripts are not required. The loader can be configured at the table, domain or project level, with the most specific setting taking precedence.

When loading files into your data warehouse, Starlake uses Spark for advanced data validation and
then uses your data warehouse's engine to append or overwrite the data.

This is done to ensure that the data is fully validated and  is loaded in the most efficient way possible.

Sometimes you may want to load the data without running any validation checks. This can be done using the `native` load mode.

You may instruct to use the native loader only for a table, a domain or for the entire project.

## Table level

In the table definition, you can specify the load mode as `native` as follows:

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml"
table:
  metadata:
    ...
    loader: native
    ...
  attributes:
  ...
```

In this case, the table will be loaded using the native loader.

## Domain level

In the domain definition, you can specify the load mode as `native` as follows:

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/_config.sl.yml"
load:
  metadata:
    ...
    loader: native
    ...
  tables:
  ...
```
In this case, all the tables in the domain will be loaded using the native loader if not otherwise specified at the table level.

## Project level

In the project definition, you can specify the load mode as `native` as follows:

```yaml title="metadata/load/application.sl.yml"
application:
  ...
  loader: native
  ...
```

In this case, all the tables in the project will be loaded using the native loader if not otherwise specified at the domain or table level.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is native load mode in Starlake?
Native load mode lets you load files directly into the data warehouse without Spark validation. This can improve performance when validation is not needed.

### How do I enable native load for a single table?
Add `loader: native` in the `metadata` section of the table YAML file (`metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml`).

### Can I enable native load mode for an entire domain?
Yes. Set `loader: native` in the `_config.sl.yml` file of the domain. All tables in the domain will use the native loader unless overridden at the table level.

### How do I enable native load for the whole project?
Set `loader: native` in `application.sl.yml`. All tables in the project will use the native loader unless overridden at the domain or table level.

### What is the configuration priority order for the loader?
Table > Domain > Project. The most specific configuration wins.

### When should I avoid native load mode?
When you need type validation, on-the-fly transformations (attribute scripts), or rejection of invalid rows. Native load mode skips all Spark-side validation.
