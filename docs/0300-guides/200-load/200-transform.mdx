# Transform on load


## Add new attributes
You may add extra attributes during load. This is useful to add extra columns that are not present in the source file such as the current timestamp or the file name

You may use any Spark SQL function to define the value of the new column and this function may reference any column of the same record in the file being loaded including the ignored ones.

The new column will be added to the table with the name you provide in the `name` property and the value will be the result of the function you provide in the `script` property.

In addition to the [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#hex) functions you can reference any of the properties available in the `_metadata` hidden column.

Available metadata properties are :

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file_name` | string | the name of the file being loaded |
| `file_path` | string | the path of the file being loaded |
| `file_size` | long | the size of the file being loaded |
| `file_modification_time` | timestamp | the last modified date of the file being loaded |


<br/>

Below is an example of how to add a new column `file_name` to the table that will contain the name of the file being loaded.

<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml" {8,10,12}
table:
  pattern: "order_line.*.csv"
  ...
  attributes:
  ...
  - name: "total_price"
    script: "quantity * sale_price"
  - name: "quantity_in_hexadecimal"
    script: "hex(quantity)"
  - name: "file_name"
    script: "_metadata.file_name"

```

## Ignore attributes
You may ignore columns during load. This is useful to avoid loading columns that are not needed in the target table or have sensitive data (GDPR).

To ignore a column, set the `ignore` attribute to `true` in the column definition.

:::tip
You may ignore a column you use inside the `script` attribute of another column.
:::


```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml" {8,10,12}
table:
  pattern: "order_line.*.csv"
  ...
  attributes:
  ...
  - name: "product_id"
    type: "int"
    ignore: true
```

## Foreign key attributes

You may define a foreign key on a column during load using the `foreignKey` property on an attribute. This will be set as a foreign key in the target table.
Some databases may not support foreign keys, in this case, the foreign key will be ignored but will still appear in the autogenerated entity-relational diagram.

<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml" {8}
table:
  pattern: "order_line.*.csv"
  ...
  attributes:
  ...
  - name: "product_id"
    type: "int"
    foreignKey: "product.id"

```
<br/>

The `foreignKey` property is defined using one of the following syntax:

| Syntax | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `foreign_key: "<table>"` | This will create a foreign key on the primary key of the specified table in the same domain. |
| `foreign_key: "<domain>.<table>"` | This will create a foreign key on the column to primary key of the specified table of the specified domain. |
| `foreign_key: "<domain>.<table>.<column>"` | This will create a foreign key on the column to the specified column in the specified table of the specified domain. |
| `foreign_key: "<table>.<column>"` | This will create a foreign key on the column to the specified column in the specified table in the same domain |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I add a computed column during load in Starlake?
Add an attribute with a `script` property in the table YAML file. The script accepts any Spark SQL function and can reference other columns in the same record.

### What functions are available in the script property?
All Spark SQL functions are available, as well as the hidden `_metadata` column properties: `file_name`, `file_path`, `file_size` and `file_modification_time`.

### How do I add the source file name as a column?
Define an attribute with `script: "_metadata.file_name"`. The name of the file being loaded will be added as the value of that column.

### Can I ignore columns during load?
Yes. Set `ignore: true` on an attribute. The column will not be loaded into the target table but remains usable in other columns' scripts.

### Can the ignore attribute help with GDPR compliance?
Yes. Ignoring an attribute containing sensitive data prevents it from being loaded into the target table. The ignored column can still be used in a script for intermediate computation.

### How do I define a foreign key on a column?
Use the `foreignKey` property on the attribute. Supported syntaxes: `"<table>"`, `"<domain>.<table>"`, `"<domain>.<table>.<column>"`, or `"<table>.<column>"`.

### Are foreign keys enforced on all warehouses?
No. Some data warehouses do not support foreign keys. In that case, the constraint is ignored at runtime but still appears in the auto-generated entity-relational diagram.

### What file metadata properties are available during load?
Four properties: `file_name` (name), `file_path` (path), `file_size` (size in bytes), and `file_modification_time` (last modification date).
