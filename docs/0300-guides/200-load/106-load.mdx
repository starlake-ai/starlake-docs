# Load

You'll use Load instead of Autoload when:
- You want to load data from a file when the separator cannot be detected easily (e.g. a file with a multichar separator)
- You want to load the data from a folders that are not in the standard `incoming` folder or that are not named after the domain name

You may use a different folder location for your incoming files by setting the `application.incoming`  variable in the `metadata/application.sl.yml` file.
<br/>



```yaml title="metadata/application.sl.yml"
application:
  incoming: /path/to/incoming
```
<br/>

You may also use a different incoming location per environment by setting the `incoming_path` variable in the `metadata/env.<env>.yml` file.

```yaml title="metadata/env.<env>.yml"
incoming_path: /path/to/incoming
```
<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/application.sl.yml"
application:
  incoming: {{incoming_path}}
```




## Domain configuration

We first need to define for each domain where the files will be loaded from.
This is done by creating a domain configuration file that describe where the `load` command should look for the files to load

<br/>

In this case the load command will look in the directory `{{incoming_path}}/starbake` where `{{incoming_path}}` is an environment variable
defined in the `metadata/env.sl.yml` file and that may be redefined for each environment (dev, test, prod) in the `metadata/env.dev.yml` file for example.

<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/_config.sl.yml"
load:
  metadata:
    directory: "{{incoming_path}}/starbake"
```
<br/>

Since the directory is set at the domain level, this means that all files loaded for this domain, will be loaded from this directory.

## Table configuration

We then need to define for each table the file format and the file name pattern that the `load` command should look for:
- [Load CSV files](csv)
- [Load JSON files](json)
- [Load XML files](xml)
- [Load fixed position files](position)
