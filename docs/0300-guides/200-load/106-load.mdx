# Manual Load: Configure Custom Separators and Incoming Paths

## When to Use Manual Load Instead of Autoload

You'll use Load instead of Autoload when:
- You want to load data from a file when the separator cannot be detected easily (e.g. a file with a multichar separator)
- You want to load the data from a folders that are not in the standard `incoming` folder or that are not named after the domain name

## Set a Custom Incoming Directory

You may use a different folder location for your incoming files by setting the `application.incoming`  variable in the `metadata/application.sl.yml` file.
<br/>



```yaml title="metadata/application.sl.yml"
application:
  area:
    incoming: /path/to/incoming
```
<br/>

### Per-Environment Incoming Path Configuration

You may also use a different incoming location per environment by setting the `incoming_path` variable in the `metadata/env.<env>.yml` file.

```yaml title="metadata/env.<env>.yml"
incoming_path: /path/to/incoming
```
<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/application.sl.yml"
application:
  area:
    incoming: "{{incoming_path}}"
```




## Domain Configuration (_config.sl.yml)

We first need to define for each domain where the files will be loaded from.
This is done by creating a domain configuration file that describe where the `load` command should look for the files to load

<br/>

In this case the load command will look in the directory `{{incoming_path}}/starbake` where `{{incoming_path}}` is an environment variable
defined in the `metadata/env.sl.yml` file and that may be redefined for each environment (dev, test, prod) in the `metadata/env.dev.yml` file for example.

<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/_config.sl.yml"
load:
  metadata:
    directory: "{{incoming_path}}/starbake"
```
<br/>

Since the directory is set at the domain level, this means that all files loaded for this domain, will be loaded from this directory.

## Table Configuration by File Format

We then need to define for each table the file format and the file name pattern that the `load` command should look for:
- [Load CSV files](csv)
- [Load JSON files](json)
- [Load XML files](xml)
- [Load fixed position files](position)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should I use manual load instead of autoload?
Use manual load when your files have a multi-character separator that autoload cannot detect, or when your files are not stored in the standard `incoming/<domain>/` directory structure.

### How do I set a custom incoming directory in Starlake?
Set the `application.area.incoming` property in `metadata/application.sl.yml`. You can use an environment variable (e.g., `{{incoming_path}}`) and define its value per environment in `metadata/env.<env>.sl.yml`.

### Can I use different incoming paths for dev, test, and prod?
Yes. Define the `incoming_path` variable in environment-specific files such as `metadata/env.dev.sl.yml` and reference it with `{{incoming_path}}` in `application.sl.yml`.

### What is a domain configuration file in Starlake?
The `_config.sl.yml` file under `metadata/load/<domain>/` defines domain-level settings, including the directory where the `load` command looks for incoming files.

### What file formats are supported for manual load?
Manual load supports CSV/DSV, JSON, XML, and fixed-width (positional) files. Each format has its own configuration page with parsing options.
