# About Metrics

Starlake computes statistical metrics on each incoming batch during ingestion. Two metric types are available: **continuous** (min, max, mean, variance, percentiles, skewness, kurtosis) for numeric attributes and **discrete** (count distinct, category frequency) for categorical attributes. Metrics are stored with an ingestion timestamp, enabling data profiling comparisons across loads.

During ingestion, Starlake may produce metrics for any attribute in the dataset. Currently, only top level attributes are supported.
One of the two available metric type may be specified on an attribute: continuous and discrete.
When the `metric` property is set to `continuous`, Starlake will compute for this attribute the following metrics:
- minimum value
- maximum value
- sum of all values
- mean: The arithmetic average
- median: the value separating the higher half from the lower half, may be thought of as "the middle" value
- variance: How far the values are spread out from their average value.
- standard deviation: square root of the variance, the standard deviation measures how spread out numbers are in a data set
- missing values
- skewness: The measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution. Negative skew commonly indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right.
- kurtosis: It tells us the extent to which the distribution is more or less outlier-prone (heavier or light-tailed) than the normal distribution. The greater the kurtosis, the less precise the standard deviation and variance become.
- 25th percentile: Returns the approximate `25 percentile` of this attribute which is the smallest value in the ordered attribute values (sorted from least to greatest) such that no more than `25%` of attribute values is less than the value or equal to that value
- 75 percentile: Returns the approximate `75 percentile` of this attribute which is the smallest value in the ordered attribute values (sorted from least to greatest) such that no more than `75%` of attribute values is less than the value or equal to that value
- row count 

When the `metric` property is set to `discrete`, Starlake will compute for this attribute the following metrics:
- count distinct: The number of distinct values for this attribute
- category frequency: The frequency (percentage) for each distinct value for this attribute
- category count: The number of occurrences for each distinct value for this attribute
- row count

Each metric is computed for each attribute only on the incoming dataset and stored in a table with the ingestion time allowing to compare metric values between loads.

Assuming we are ingesting a file with the following schema:

```
|-- business_id: string (nullable = false)
|-- name: string (nullable = true)
|-- address: string (nullable = true)
|-- city: string (nullable = true) 
|-- state: string (nullable = true)
|-- postal_code: string (nullable = true)
|-- latitude: double (nullable = true)
|-- longitude: double (nullable = true)
|-- stars: double (nullable = true)
|-- review_count: long (nullable = true)
|-- is_open: long (nullable = true)
```

with the attributes `city` is marked as discrete and `review_count` is marked as continuous

The following tables would be generated:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What types of metrics does Starlake compute during ingestion?
Two types: **continuous** (min, max, mean, median, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, percentiles 25/75, missing values, row count) and **discrete** (count distinct, category frequency, category count, row count).

### How do I enable metrics on an attribute?
Set the `metric` property on the attribute in the table YAML file. Use `continuous` for numeric metrics or `discrete` for categorical metrics.

### Where are ingestion metrics stored?
Metrics are stored in dedicated tables in the data warehouse, with an ingestion timestamp allowing you to compare values between successive loads.

### Can I compute metrics on nested attributes?
No. Currently, only top-level attributes are supported for metric computation.

### What continuous metrics are computed?
Minimum, maximum, sum, mean, median, variance, standard deviation, missing values, skewness, kurtosis, percentile 25, percentile 75 and row count.

### What discrete metrics are computed?
Count distinct, category frequency (percentage), category count (number of occurrences per distinct value) and row count.

### Are metrics computed on all data or only the incoming batch?
Only on the incoming batch. Each computation is associated with the ingestion timestamp, enabling tracking over time.
