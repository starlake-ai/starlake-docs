# OpenAPI Schema Extraction

Starlake can generate table schemas from OpenAPI definitions by mapping API routes and response schemas to Starlake domains and tables. The mapping is configured in a YAML file that supports route filtering, schema exclusion, explode strategies for nested structures, and attribute name normalization. By default, Starlake processes GET operations and filters out schemas that are not objects or arrays of objects.

## How to Extract Schemas from OpenAPI Definitions

1. **Define the OpenAPI-Starlake mapping** -- Create a YAML config in `metadata/extract/` specifying `connectionRef`, `basePath`, domains, route filters, schema exclusions, and explode strategies.
2. **Configure the filesystem connection** -- In `metadata/application.sl.yml`, add a connection of type `fs` pointing to the OpenAPI JSON definition file.
3. **Place the OpenAPI definition file** -- Drop the OpenAPI JSON file into `metadata/extract/openapi/` (or the path specified in the connection).
4. **Run the extract-schema command** -- Execute `starlake extract-schema --config my_openapi_extract_config` to generate Starlake table definitions in the load folder.

## Overview
The schema extraction process leverages YAML configuration to define relations between Starlake's domains and tables with OpenAPI definitions.
This configuration supports advanced features like excluding routes or fields, and handling explosion strategies for complex data structures.
Table names are deduced from paths and normalized. Attribute names are normalized as well in order for them to be compatible with databases.

Generally speaking, what we are interested in an OpenAPI definition are GET operations and their schema. Starlake filters out schemas that are not objects or arrays of objects. Furthermore, the extraction flattens root arrays and considers the output to match JSON Lines.

## Extract step-by-step

### 1. Define OpenAPI-Starlake Mapping

In `metadata/extract/` defines a YAML config file, here named `my_openapi_extract_config.sl.yml`.

```yaml {7,8} title="metadata/extract/my_openapi_extract_config.sl.yml"
version: 1
extract:
  connectionRef: "my_open_api"
  openAPI:
    basePath: /api/v2
    domains:
      - name: api
        schemas:
          exclude:
            - Model\.Common\.Id
        routes:
          - paths:
              - ^/api/v2/clients/\{id}/details$
            explode:
              on: ARRAY
              rename:
                postal_adresses: adresses
```

The given example don't highlight all possible configuration. Let's break the configuration down and see how you may define yours:

- sanitizeAttributeName: One of :
  - ON_EXTRACT: attribute name is sanitized and stored as field name. Default.
  - ON_LOAD: attribute name is sanitized and stored as rename property when attribute's name differs from sanitized name
- connectionRef: reference a FS connection indicating where the open API file is
- openAPI:
  - basePath: paths are used for table names. This base path is remove before table name is produced.
  - formatTypeMapping: map of String, String allowing to map a custom format to a starlake type. By default, if the format is not standard, the type is resolved as String.
  - domains:
    - basePath: same as root's one but override its for the domain. May be interesting if root base path is /api/v2 and we want to create re referential domain where api are all located under /api/v2/referentials/. Otherwise we would get table name like `referentials_products` instead of `products`.
    - name: starlake domain name. Group multiple root under one specific domain.
    - schemas: apply `include` then `exclude` list. OpenAPI have named schemas. If you are facing an OpenAPI definitions
    where you want to discard specific schemas, just add it to `exclude` list. These may be an API where it requires you to list all ids before gettings the details of each of them. In contrary, if you are only interested by some schemas, use `include` list.
    - routes:
      - paths: all paths to include in the process. If regex is too complex, you may add multiple entries. By default, takes all paths.
      - as: force the table name. Be sure that eligible `paths` are outputting only one schema. Otherwise an error is thrown during process because of collision.
      - operations: GET or POST. By default, it is GET.
      - exclude: paths to exclude. Detect `paths` first and then exclude them.
      - excludeFields: in the response schema's, the API may define some deprecated attributes that you may want to drop. Just add their patterns.
      - explode:
        - on: May be one of :
          - ALL: Keep properties of type object or array.
          - ARRAY: Keep properties of type object. Don't dive on array type.
          - OBJECT: Keep properties of type array. If encounters an object, dive deeper.
        - exclude: list of properties to ignore. Sub properties are concatenated to thei parent with `_`. I.e `postal.address.number` become `postal_address_number`.
        - rename: each exploded schemas are saved by default to a table named: `{api_path}_{property_path}`. If you don't want, you can use `rename` to match a property path to a table name. It's a map of `table_name -> property pattern`. If you force the renaming to `""`, then the output table will be `api_path`. It won't be suffixed with a dangling `_`.


### 2. Define file connections to the OpenAPI definition file
```yaml {7,8} title="metadata/application.sl.yml"
version: 1
application:
  connections:
    my_open_api:
        type: "fs"
        options:
            path: my_open_api_file.json
```

`path` defines the location to the openAPI definition. By convention, these file will be in `metadata/extract/openapi`
but you are free to specify an absolute location or use a substituted variable.

### 3. Drop your OpenAPI definition
According to the defined connection, you can drop your openAPI definition into `metadata/extract/openapi/my_open_api_file.json`.

### 4. Extract

Now, you just have to launch schema extraction. Schema extraction will extract to the `load` folder by default but you can specify another one with `outputDir`.
If any domain or table exists, they are merged together.

```shell
$ starlake extract-schema --config my_openapi_extract_config
```

## Name normalization
You may need to know how Starlake normalize names in order to apply those same transformation in your code and get a perfect match.

### Table name
Table names are deduced from path. This is how they are normalized:
- remove path parameters
- remove all accents
- replace non alpha numeric with underscore
- replace consecutive/trailing underscores
- add underscore before capitals preceded by lowercase
- add underscore after a group of capitals
- lower all

### Attribute name
Attribute names are normalized as follows:
- remove all accents
- replace non alpha numeric with underscore
- replace consecutive/trailing underscores
- add underscore before capitals preceded by lowercase
- add underscore after a group of capitals

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What OpenAPI operations does Starlake extract?
By default, Starlake extracts GET operations. POST operations can be configured via the `operations` field in the `routes` section. Schemas that are not objects or arrays of objects are filtered out.

### How are table names generated from OpenAPI paths?
Starlake removes path parameters, removes accents, replaces non-alphanumeric characters with underscores, adds underscores before capitals preceded by lowercase, and lowercases everything.

### What does the basePath field do in OpenAPI extraction?
The `basePath` is removed from the beginning of the path before generating the table name. This avoids unnecessary prefixes in the names. It can be defined at root level or at domain level.

### How do I exclude schemas or routes in Starlake OpenAPI extraction?
Use `schemas.exclude` to exclude schemas by name (regex supported) and `routes.exclude` to exclude paths. `schemas.include` allows keeping only certain schemas.

### How does the explode strategy work in Starlake OpenAPI extraction?
The `explode.on` field defines how Starlake treats complex properties: `ALL` keeps objects and arrays, `ARRAY` keeps objects but does not dive into arrays, `OBJECT` keeps arrays but dives deeper into objects.

### What is sanitizeAttributeName in Starlake OpenAPI extraction?
Two modes: `ON_EXTRACT` (default) sanitizes the name and stores it directly as the field name. `ON_LOAD` sanitizes the name and stores it as a `rename` property when it differs from the original name.

### What type of connection is required for OpenAPI extraction?
A connection of type `fs` (filesystem) pointing to the OpenAPI definition file (JSON). The file is by convention placed in `metadata/extract/openapi/`.
