# Connections

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Connections are defined in the `connections` section under the root attribute `application`.


The following types of connections are supported:

- [Local File System](#local-file-system)
- [BigQuery](#google-bigquery)
- [Spark / Databricks](#apache-spark--databricks)
- [Snowflake](#snowflake)
- [Redshift](#amazon-redshift)
- [Postgres](#postgres)


## Local File System

The local file system connection is used to read and write files to the local file system.

```yaml
application:
    connections:
    local:
        type: local
```

Files will be stored in the `area` directory under the `datasets` directory.
Défault values for `area` and `datasets` can be set in the `application` section.

```yaml
application:
    datasets = "{{root}}/datasets" # or set it through the SL_DATASETS environnement variable.
    area:
        pending: "pending" # Location where files of pending load are stored. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_PENDING} environment variable.
        unresolved: "unresolved" # Location where files that do not match any pattern are moved. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_UNRESOLVED} environment variable.
        archive: "archive" # Location where files are moved after they have been processed. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_ARCHIVE} environment variable.
        ingesting: "ingesting" # Location where files are moved while they are being processed. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_INGESTING} environment variable.
        accepted: "accepted" # Location where files are moved after they have been processed and accepted. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_ACCEPTED} environment variable.
        rejected: "rejected" # Location where files are moved after they have been processed and rejected. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_REJECTED} environment variable.
        business: "business" # Location where transform tasks store their result. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_BUSINESS} environment variable.
        replay: "replay" # Location rejected records are stored in their orginial format. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_REPLAY} environment variable.
        hiveDatabase: "${domain}_${area}" # Hive database name. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_HIVE_DATABASE} environment variable.

```

## Google BigQuery

Starlake support native and spark bigquery connections.

    bigquery:
      type: "bigquery"
      # Uncomment the line below to use the spark bigquery connector instead of the native one.

## Snowflake

### User / Password Auth
<Tabs groupId="snow_connections">

<TabItem label="Snowflake" value="snow-jdbc">

You may use the native Snowflake JDBC driver or the Spark Snowflake connector. The native driver is recommended for most use cases.
The Spark Snowflake connector is only required when exporting data from Snowflake to Excel or CSV / Parquet / ... files or when loading data from 
to Snowflake using the Starlake Spark embedded library .




```yaml

application:
  connections:
    snowflake:
      type: jdbc
      # Uncomment the line below to use the Snowflake Spark embedded library instead of the Snowflake JDBC connector.
      # sparkFormat: snowflake 
      options:
        url: "jdbc:snowflake://{{SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT}}.snowflakecomputing.com"
        driver: "net.snowflake.client.jdbc.SnowflakeDriver"
        user: {{SNOWFLAKE_USER}}
        password: {{SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD}}
        warehouse: {{SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE}}
        db: {{SNOWFLAKE_DB}}
        keep_column_case: "off"
        preActions: "alter session set TIMESTAMP_TYPE_MAPPING = 'TIMESTAMP_LTZ';ALTER SESSION SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASE = true"
                sfUrl: "{{SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT}}.snowflakecomputing.com" # make sure you do not prefix by jdbc:snowflake://. This is done by the snowflaek driver
        #sfUrl: "jdbc:snowflake://{{SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT}}.snowflakecomputing.com" # make sure the key is prefixed with 'sf' is 'sparkFormat' is set
        # sfUser: {{SNOWFLAKE_USER}} # make sure the key is prefixed with 'sf' is 'sparkFormat' is set
        # sfPassword: {{SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD}} # make sure the key is prefixed with 'sf' is 'sparkFormat' is set
        # sfWarehouse: {{SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE}} # make sure the key is prefixed with 'sf' is 'sparkFormat' is set
        # sfDatabase: {{SNOWFLAKE_DB}} # make sure the key is prefixed with 'sf' is 'sparkFormat' is set

### Single Sign On (OAuth)

__Single Sign-On with Snowflake OAuth__

Single Sign-On (SSO) is supported via the oauth authentication type, which is only compatible with the native Snowflake JDBC driver.

You can continue using the same configuration as before. 
Once the user is authenticated through Snowflake, Starlake will automatically use the oauth authentication type to connect. 
The user and password fields will be ignored and replaced by the user token generated by Snowflake.

__Configuring Snowflake OAuth__

To use Snowflake OAuth, you need to configure the following settings in your Snowflake account:
	1.	Log in to Snowflake using the ACCOUNTADMIN role or another role with the global CREATE INTEGRATION privilege.
	2.	Execute the following SQL command to create a new OAuth integration:


```sql
-- Create a new OAuth integration
CREATE OR REPLACE SECURITY INTEGRATION STARLAKE
  TYPE = OAUTH
  ENABLED = TRUE
  OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM
  OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = 'CONFIDENTIAL'
  OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = '<REDIRECT_URI>'
  OAUTH_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS = TRUE
  OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY = 7776000; -- Valid for 90 days
  OAUTH_USE_SECONDARY_ROLES = 'IMPLICIT'; 
```


__OAuth Redirect URI__

REDIRECT_URI refers to the URL that Snowflake will redirect to after authentication:
- If you’re running Starlake on your local machine, use: ```http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/snowflake/callback```

- If you’re running Starlake as a native app on Snowflake, the redirect URI will be: ```https://<account>.snowflakecomputing.com/api/v1/auth/snowflake/callback```



__Token Validity__

The access token provided by Snowflake is valid for 10 minutes. 
However, the refresh token—valid for 90 days—will automatically renew the access token as needed. After 90 days, the user must reauthenticate.


__Retrieving Integration Credentials__

To extract your account name, client ID, and client secret from the integration you just created, run the following SQL query:

⸻

```sql
WITH SECURITY_INTEGRATION as (
  SELECT PARSE_JSON(SYSTEM$SHOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS('STARLAKE')) as OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS
)
select
CURRENT_ORGANIZATION_NAME() || '-' || CURRENT_ACCOUNT_NAME() as account,
  OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS:"OAUTH_CLIENT_ID"::string     as client_id,
  OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS:"OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"::string as client_secret
from
  SECURITY_INTEGRATION;
```

In the Starlake UI, log in as an admin and navigate to the Admin page. 
Then, click on the ```Snowflake SSO``` tab. Enter the ```Account```, ```Client ID```, and ```Client Secret``` fields using the values you extracted from Snowflake.
