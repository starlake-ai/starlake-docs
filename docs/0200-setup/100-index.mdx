Starlake is an enterprise-grade data pipeline platform that revolutionizes data integration for organizations. 
By employing a declarative approach using YAML and SQL, it minimizes complex coding while ensuring robust data governance and quality.

Starlake offers three deployment options:

**Starlake Self Hosted:** 
Building upon Starlake CLI, this version also brings in a web-based user interface for managing your projects through a browser. 
It includes all command-line functionalities, along with advanced UI and AI features. 
Starlake is free to use and can be deployed on your own infrastructure, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

This fully managed cloud-based version of Starlake offers all platform features and is available as a subscription service.
