# Starlake Setup: Self Hosted vs Cloud Deployment Options

Starlake is a declarative data pipeline platform that uses YAML and SQL to define data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration. It enforces data governance and quality while minimizing custom code. Starlake supports two deployment modes: **Self Hosted** and **Starlake Cloud**. Both include the CLI, a web UI, AI-assisted features, and orchestration with Airflow or Dagster.

## Starlake Self Hosted: Free Deployment On-Premise or Cloud

Starlake Self Hosted runs on your own infrastructure. You deploy it on-premise or in any cloud environment (AWS, GCP, Azure). It includes the full command-line interface, a web-based UI for managing projects through a browser, AI features, and orchestration capabilities. Starlake Self Hosted is free to use with no license fees.

Key characteristics:
- **Cost**: Free
- **Deployment**: On-premise or your own cloud account
- **Control**: You manage the infrastructure and updates
- **Setup**: Install the CLI locally or via Docker, then optionally deploy with Airflow or Dagster using Docker Compose

## Starlake Cloud: Managed SaaS Service

Starlake Cloud is a fully managed version of the platform. It provides the same features as Self Hosted but removes the need to manage infrastructure. Starlake Cloud is available as a subscription service.

Key characteristics:
- **Cost**: Subscription
- **Deployment**: SaaS (managed by Starlake)
- **Control**: Infrastructure is managed for you
- **Setup**: Sign up and start building pipelines
