Starlake is a declarative data pipeline platform that uses YAML and SQL to define data pipelines, minimizing custom code while enforcing data governance and quality. It supports two deployment modes: Self Hosted (free, on-premise or cloud) and Starlake Cloud (managed SaaS). Both options include the CLI, a web-based UI, AI-assisted features, and orchestration with Airflow or Dagster.

Starlake offers two deployment options:

**Starlake Self Hosted:** 
Building upon Starlake CLI, this version also brings in a web-based user interface for managing your projects through a browser. 
It includes all command-line functionalities, along with advanced UI and AI features. 
Starlake is free to use and can be deployed on your own infrastructure, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

**Starlake Cloud:** 
This fully managed cloud-based version of Starlake offers all platform features and is available as a subscription service.
