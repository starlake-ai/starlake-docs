Starlake competes with tools like DLT and DBT, offering unique advantages in several areas:

Compared to DLT:

Declarative Configuration: Starlake’s load features (https://starlake.ai/starlake/docs/intro#load) are based on a YAML DSL, making it simpler and more declarative compared to Python-based approaches.
Performance: Unlike pandas-based solutions, Starlake scales seamlessly both vertically and horizontally, ensuring instant scalability.
Productivity: Configurations can be automatically inferred from a sample of your data files, saving time and effort.
Unit Testing: Starlake supports unit testing for data loads using an embedded DuckDB database. This allows tests to run locally or in your CI/CD pipeline, generating reports that can be published on your CI portal.
Security: It enforces column- and row-level security grants on loaded tables, ensuring data protection and compliance.
Flexible Write Strategies: Starlake supports custom write strategies or predefined ones such as OVERWRITE, APPEND, UPSERT_BY_KEY, UPSERT_BY_KEY_AND_TIMESTAMP, OVERWRITE_BY_PARTITION, and SLOW_CHANGING_DIMENSION_TYPE_2.
Integration with Orchestrators: Starlake comes out of the box with predefined templates for Airflow and Dagster, which can be customized to work with other orchestration tools as needed.
User-Friendly Interface: Beyond its no-code/low-code capabilities, Starlake features an advanced UI. You can explore it in action at Starlake’s website (https://starlake.ai then click “Learn More”).
Compared to DBT:

Built-in Lineage Support: Starlake offers out-of-the-box column and table level lineage tracking for regular SQL, without the need for ref jinja helpers.
Effortless Incremental Models: Fully supports incremental models without placing any burden on the developer. No macros or state management are required, as it leverages your orchestrator’s capabilities.
Automated DAG Generation: Starlake analyzes your SQL transformations to automatically generate DAGs and model dependencies, ensuring models execute in the correct order.
Unified YAML DSL: For consistency and simplicity, Starlake uses the same YAML DSL for common features across both load and transform activities, including security, write strategies, partitioning, clustering, job scheduling, and metadata management.
Flexible Unit Testing: Write your transformations in the SQL dialect of your choice—whether it’s BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Spark SQL, or PostgreSQL. Seamlessly test these transformations locally using DuckDB or within your CI pipeline. This is powered by JSQLTranspiler.
Intuitive User Interface: Like the load feature, Starlake’s transformation capabilities are supported by a user-friendly interface (see the link above in the Load section).
