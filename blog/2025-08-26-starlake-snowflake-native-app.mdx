## **Starlake Snowflake Native App**

We're excited to announce that **Starlake** will soon be available as a **Snowflake Native App**, bringing our declarative, AI-powered data pipeline automation **natively inside your Snowflake environment**.

With this new native integration, Snowflake users will be able to **ingest, transform, validate, and orchestrate pipelines**, all without leaving their Snowflake account, and without managing external infrastructure.


### **Why Build Natively in Snowflake?**

At Starlake, we believe the best data pipelines are:

* **Simple to build**
* **Secure by design**
* **Governed end-to-end**
* **Fully aligned with your data platform**

By building directly on **Snowflake's Native Application Framework**, Starlake offers a deeply integrated experience that:


* Executes entirely within your Snowflake account
* Uses **Snowflake Tasks, SQL and AI** under the hood
* Eliminates data movement, improving **both performance and security**
* Keeps you compliant with Snowflake's governance and billing model

In short: 

* **No data movement.**
* **No orchestration glue code.**
* **Just powerful, declarative pipelines that run where your data lives while leveraging Snowflake's capabilities.**

### **What Can You Expect?**

With the Starlake Snowflake Native App, you'll be able to:

**Define pipelines declaratively** Use YAML or our visual UI to specify ingestion, transformations, validations, and orchestration.

**Run natively inside Snowflake** All execution happens in your Snowflake environment, no external runtimes or data movement.

**Automate orchestration** Starlake auto-generates Snowflake Tasks and DAGs, with full dependency tracking and scheduling.

**Enforce data quality and lineage** Built-in rules and column-level lineage ensure trust in your data.

**Leverage AI to build faster** Our AI Copilot helps generate pipeline code from natural language prompts, accelerating onboarding and development.

### **Why It Matters**

Most modern data teams face the same core challenges:

* Orchestration complexity
* Pipeline sprawl
* Lack of data quality enforcement
* Security and compliance risks from data movement
* Fragile, hard-to-maintain workflows
* Unpredictable pricing models tied to number of runs

Starlake + Snowflake directly addresses these pain points with a **secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform** that empowers both engineers and analysts to deliver trusted data products faster.

And unlike other solutions, Starlake offers fair, predictable pricing not based on the number of runs or tasks. That means unlimited pipelines and orchestration without worrying about hidden costs.

Whether you're building production-grade ELT pipelines, enabling self-service analytics, or scaling governed data platforms, **Starlake's Snowflake Native App is built to help you do it better, faster, and fully within Snowflake**.
