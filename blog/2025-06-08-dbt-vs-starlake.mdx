## Starlake vs. Dbt Fusion: Why Openness Wins

Dbt recently launched **Dbt Fusion**, a performance-oriented upgrade to their transformation tooling.  
Itâ€™s faster, smarter, and offers features long requested by the community â€” but it comes bundled with tighter control, paid subscriptions, and runtime lock-in.

**We've been there all along but without the trade-offs.**


At **Starlake**, we believe great data engineering doesnâ€™t have to come with trade-offs.

We've taken a different approach from the start:

âœ… **Free and open-source core (Apache 2)**  
âœ… **No runtime lock-in**  
âœ… **Auto-generated orchestration** for Airflow, Dagster, Snowflake Tasks, and more  
âœ… **Production-grade seed and transform** tools

Letâ€™s break it down.


### Feature-by-Feature Comparison


- Fast engine: Starlake uses a **Scala-based engine** for lightning-fast performance, while Dbt Fusion relies on a **Rust-based engine**.
- Native SQL comprehension: Both tools support native SQL semantics.
- State-aware orchestration: Dbt Fusion's orchestration is limited to Dbt Cloud, while Starlake generates DAGs for **any orchestrator** with ready ones for Airflow, Dagster, and Snowflake Tasks.
- Cost management: Dbt Fusion uses the SDF Engine for cost management, while Starlake leverages **OSS JSQLParser** and **JSQLTranspiler** for cost-effective SQL transformations.
- Lineage & governance: Dbt Fusion offers lineage and governance features in their paid tier, while Starlake provides these capabilities for free.
- Web-based visual editor: Dbt Fusion's visual editor is part of their paid tier, while Starlake offers a free web-based visual editor.
- Platform integration: aka. Consistent experience across all interfaces, Dbt Fusion's platform integration is available in their paid tier, while Starlake provides free integration with various platforms.
- Data seeding: Dbt Fusion supports CSV-only data seeding, while Starlake offers **full support for various data formats (CSV, JSON, XML, Fixed Length ...)** with schema validation and user-defined materialization strategies.
- On-Premise / BYO Cloud: Dbt Fusion does not offer an on-premise or BYO cloud option, while Starlake supports both allowing you to use the same tools and codebase across environments.
- VSCode extension: Dbt Fusion's VSCode extension is free for up to 15 users, while Starlake's extension is always free.
- SaaS Offering: Dbt Fusion is a SaaS offering, while Starlake is open-source with a **SaaS offering coming soon**.
- MCP Server: Dbt Fusion's MCP Server requires a paid subscription for tools use, while Starlake provides a free full-fledged MCP Server for managing your data pipelines.

### Strategy Matters As Much As Features

Many tools advertise flexibility - but in practice, they quietly funnel users into proprietary runtimes.  
Dbt Fusion is no exception.

Their orchestrator is gated behind a paid cloud platform, and most features require a subscription once your team grows.

**Starlake doesnâ€™t play that game.**

We provide:
- **A single declarative YAML layer** for ingest, transform, validate, and orchestrate
- **One config = Multiple warehouses** (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshiftâ€¦)
- **Your orchestrator = Your choice**, fully integrated
- **Auto-generated DAGs**, no manual workflow wiring
- **Run it locally, in the cloud, or anywhere in between**

### Who Should Choose Starlake?

Starlake is ideal for:
- Data teams who want **speed without lock-in**
- Enterprises who need **production-grade on premise and cloud data pipelines** without vendor lock-in
- Startups who want **open-source pricing** and **cloud-scale performance**
- Teams who prefer **Airflow, Dagster, Google Cloud Composer, AWS Managed Airflow, Asttronomer, Snowflake Tasks**, or any engine they already trust

Whether you're building your first pipeline or managing thousands across clouds, **Starlake lets you grow on your terms**.

## Final Thought

Dbt Fusion makes bold claims â€” and to their credit, theyâ€™ve pushed the modern data stack forward.

But openness without freedom is just marketing.

**Starlake gives you both.**  
âœ… Open-source.  
âœ… Free to use.  
âœ… Orchestrate anywhere.
