## Starlake vs. Dbt Fusion: Why Openness Wins

Dbt recently launched **Dbt Fusion**, a performance-oriented upgrade to their transformation tooling.  
It’s faster, smarter, and offers features long requested by the community — but it comes bundled with tighter control, paid subscriptions, and runtime lock-in.

**We've been there all along but without the trade-offs.**


At **Starlake**, we believe great data engineering doesn’t have to come with trade-offs.

We've taken a different approach from the start:

✅ **Free and open-source core (Apache 2)**  
✅ **No runtime lock-in**  
✅ **Auto-generated orchestration** for Airflow, Dagster, Snowflake Tasks, and more  
✅ **Production-grade seed and transform** tools

Let’s break it down.


### Feature-by-Feature Comparison

:::note

Disclaimer: Dbt offers a free tier for teams with fewer than 15 users.
This comparison focuses on organizations with more than 15 users, where most of Dbt Fusion’s advanced features are gated behind a paid subscription.

:::

- Fast engine: Starlake uses a **Scala-based engine** for lightning-fast performance, while Dbt Fusion relies on a **Rust-based engine**.
- Database offloading: Dbt Fusion uses SDF and DataFusion, while Starlake leverages **[JSQLParser](https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser)** and DuckDB for cost-effective SQL transformations and database offloading.
- Native SQL comprehension:  Both tools enable real-time error detection, SQL autocompletion and context-aware assistance without needing to hit the data warehouse. The difference ? With Dbt Fusion, it’s a paid feature. With Starlake, it’s free and open.
- State-aware orchestration: Dbt Fusion's orchestration is limited to Dbt Saas Offering, while Starlake generates DAGs for **any orchestrator** with ready ones for Airflow, Dagster, and Snowflake Tasks.
- Lineage & governance: Dbt Fusion offers lineage and governance features in their paid tier, while Starlake provides these capabilities for free and open.
- Web-based visual editor: Dbt Fusion comes with aYAML editor only as part of their paid tier, while Starlake offers a in addition to a YAML editor, a free web-based visual editor.
- Platform integration: aka. Consistent experience across all interfaces, Dbt Fusion's platform integration is available in their paid tier, while Starlake provides free integration with various platforms.
- Data seeding: Dbt Fusion supports CSV-only data seeding, while Starlake offers **full support for various data formats (CSV, JSON, XML, Fixed Length ...)** with schema validation and user-defined materialization strategies.
- On-Premise / BYO Cloud: Dbt Fusion does not offer an on-premise or BYO cloud option, while Starlake supports both allowing you to use the same tools and codebase across environments.
- VSCode extension: Dbt Fusion's VSCode extension is free for up to 15 users, while Starlake's extension is always free.
- SaaS Offering: Dbt Fusion is a SaaS offering, while Starlake is open-source with a **SaaS offering coming soon**.
- MCP Server: Dbt Fusion's MCP Server requires a paid subscription for tools use, while Starlake provides a free full-fledged MCP Server for managing your data pipelines.
- SQL Productivity tools: Dbt comes with DBT Canva, a paid product, at Starlake this is handled by Starlake Copilot through english prompts, which is free and open-source.

### Strategy Matters As Much As Features

Many tools advertise flexibility - but in practice, they quietly funnel users into proprietary runtimes.  
Dbt Fusion is no exception.

Their orchestrator is gated behind a paid cloud platform, and most features require a subscription once your team grows.

**Starlake doesn’t play that game.**

We provide:
- **A single declarative YAML layer** for extract, ingest, transform, validate, and orchestrate
- **One config = Multiple warehouses** (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift…)
- **Your orchestrator = Your choice**, fully integrated
- **Auto-generated DAGs**, no manual workflow wiring
- **Run it locally, in the cloud, or anywhere in between**

---

### Who Should Choose Starlake?

Starlake is ideal for:
- Data teams who want **speed without lock-in**
- Enterprises who need **production-grade on premise and cloud data pipelines** without vendor lock-in
- Startups who want **open-source pricing** and **cloud-scale performance**
- Teams who prefer **Airflow, Dagster, Google Cloud Composer, AWS Managed Airflow, Asttronomer, Snowflake Tasks**, or any engine they already trust

Whether you're building your first pipeline or managing thousands across clouds, **Starlake lets you grow on your terms**.

## Final Thought

Dbt Fusion makes bold claims — and to their credit, they’ve pushed the modern data stack forward.

But openness without freedom is just marketing.

**Starlake gives you both.**  
✅ Open-source.  
✅ Free to use.  
✅ Orchestrate anywhere.
