# Load JSON Files


Loading a JSON file is similar to loading a CSV file except that JSON attributes may have nested attributes.


## Infer schema

The very first step is to infer the schema of the file from a data file as described in the [autoload section](autoload#how-autoload-detects-the-format-of-the-files) before you start customizing your configuration. This is done using the `infer-schema` command. This will bootstrap the configuration file for the table.

```bash

starlake infer-schema --input-path incoming/starbake

```

## Parsing JSON

Like other file formats, JSON Parsing options are defined in the `metadata` section of the configuration file.

The `format`attribute may be set to one of the values below:

| Format | Description |
| --- | --- |
| JSON | The JSON file is parsed as a list of objects, one object per line |
| JSON_FLAT | The JSON objects do not contain any repeated or nested fields. Using this format instead of JSON makes file parsing faster |
| JSON_ARRAY | The JSON file is parsed as a single array of objects |

<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml - parsing section"
table:
  pattern: "order_line.*.csv"
  metadata:
    format: "JSON" # or "JSON_FLAT" since the JSON objects do not contain any repeated or nested fields
    ...
  attributes:
    - ...
```


## Attributes validation

The `attributes` section of the configuration file is used to define the attributes of the JSON file.
The `attributes` section is a list of objects, each object representing an attribute of the JSON file.
In addition to the common attributes, the `attributes` section may contain the following attributes:
- 'array' (optional): The attribute is an array of objects. The value of this attribute is a list of objects, each object representing an attribute of the array.
- 'struct' (optional): The attribute is an object containing other attributes.

Given the Json record below:

```json
{
  "order_id": 1,
  "order_date": "2021-01-01",
  "order_lines": [
    {
      "line_id": 1,
      "product_id": 1,
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "line_id": 2,
      "product_id": 2,
      "quantity": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

The `attributes` section of the configuration file would be:

```yaml title="metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml - attributes section"
table:
  pattern: "order_line.*.csv"
  metadata:
    format: "JSON"
    ...
  attributes:
    - name: "order_id"
      type: "integer"
    - name: "order_date"
      type: "date"
    - name: "order_lines"
      type: "struct"
      array: true
      attributes:
        - name: "line_id"
          type: "integer"
        - name: "product_id"
          type: "integer"
        - name: "quantity"
          type: "integer"
```
