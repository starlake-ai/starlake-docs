# Type validation



starlake allows you to validate the types of the data you are loading.
This is done by specifying the schema of the data you are writing.
This schema, generally infered from sample data, is described using the YAML syntax in the `attributes`section of
the `metadata/load/<domain>/<table>.sl.yml` file.

The `order_line` table may be described as follows:
<br/>

```yaml {7,9,11,13} title="metadata/load/starbake/order_line.sl.yml - validation section"
table:
  pattern: "order_line.*.csv"
  metadata:
    - ...
  attributes:
  - name: "order_id"
    type: "int"
  - name: "product_id"
    type: "int"
  - name: "quantity"
    type: "int"
  - name: "sale_price"
    type: "double"
```
<br/>

`int` and `double` are what we call the basic types and are mapped to the corresponding SQL types.

## Basic types

## Custom types

You may redefine existing standard types or define your own types in the `metadata/types` directory in a file named `custom.sl.yml`.

This allows you to run your input data against advanced validation rules.

Below is an example of a custom type definition:

<br/>

```yaml title="metadata/types/custom.sl.yml"

types:
  - name: "email"
    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    primitiveType: "string"
    sample: "
    comment: "Email address"
  - name: "phone"
    pattern: "^[0-9]{10}$"
    primitiveType: "string"
    sample: "1234567890"
    comment: "Phone number"
  - name: "zip_code"
    pattern: "^[0-9]{5}$"
    primitiveType: "string"
    sample: "12345"
    comment: "Zip code"
```
<br/>


Note that you have to map the custom type to a primitive type, which is the type that will be used in the SQL schema.

The following primitive types are supported:
- string
- long
- double
- byte
- short
- boolean
- timestamp
- decimal
- date
