# Monitoring

Starlake keeps track of the successive extractions in the table `SL_LAST_EXPORT` located in the audit schema (`audit` by default).

The connection to the audit schema is defined in the `metadata/application.sl.yml` file.

```yaml
version: 1
application:
  audit:
    domain: "audit" # Schema name
    sink:
      connectionRef: "audit_connection" # Connection to the audit schema

  connections:
    audit_connection:
      type: "jdbc"
      options:
        url: "jdbc:duckdb:{{SL_ROOT}}/datasets/duckdb.db" # Location of the DuckDB database
        driver: "org.duckdb.DuckDBDriver"
    ...
```
