# Incremental extraction

Incremental extraction is useful when you want to extract only the data that has changed since the last extraction.
This is useful when you have a large dataset and only a small portion of the data changes frequently.

To enable incremental extraction, you need to provide a column that can be used to identify the new rows.
This column is called the `partitionColumn`.


```yaml {7,8} title="metadata/extract/my_extract_config.sl.yml"
extract:
  connectionRef: "duckdb" # The database connection to use
  jdbcSchemas:
    - schema: "starbake"
      tables:
        - name: "order"               # table names or  "*" to extract all tables
          fullExport: false           # (optional) set to true to do a full export
          partitionColumn: "order_id" # (optional) column to use for incremental extraction
  ...
```
