# Connections

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Connections are defined in the `connections` section under the root attribute `application`.


The following types of connections are supported:

- [Local File System](#local-file-system)
- [BigQuery](#google-bigquery)
- [Spark / Databricks](#apache-spark--databricks)
- [Snowflake](#snowflake)
- [Redshift](#amazon-redshift)
- [Postgres](#postgres)


## Local File System

The local file system connection is used to read and write files to the local file system.

```yaml
application:
    connections:
    local:
        type: local
```

Files will be stored in the `area` directory under the `datasets` directory.
DÃ©fault values for `area` and `datasets` can be set in the `application` section.

```yaml
application:
    datasets = "{{root}}/datasets" # or set it through the SL_DATASETS environnement variable.
    area:
        pending: "pending" # Location where files of pending load are stored. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_PENDING} environment variable.
        unresolved: "unresolved" # Location where files that do not match any pattern are moved. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_UNRESOLVED} environment variable.
        archive: "archive" # Location where files are moved after they have been processed. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_ARCHIVE} environment variable.
        ingesting: "ingesting" # Location where files are moved while they are being processed. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_INGESTING} environment variable.
        accepted: "accepted" # Location where files are moved after they have been processed and accepted. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_ACCEPTED} environment variable.
        rejected: "rejected" # Location where files are moved after they have been processed and rejected. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_REJECTED} environment variable.
        business: "business" # Location where transform tasks store their result. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_BUSINESS} environment variable.
        replay: "replay" # Location rejected records are stored in their orginial format. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_REPLAY} environment variable.
        hiveDatabase: "${domain}_${area}" # Hive database name. May be overloaded by the ${SL_AREA_HIVE_DATABASE} environment variable.

```
