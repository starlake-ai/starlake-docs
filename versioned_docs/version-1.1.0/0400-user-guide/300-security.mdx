Once loaded in the data warehouse, the data is accessible to all users. You may want to restrict access to some tables or rows to some users or groups of users.
This is done using the access control attributes. 


### Table Level Access Control

To restrict access at the table level, you can use the `acl` attribute in the table configuration file (load or transform).

```yaml 
    acl:
      - role: viewer
        grants:
          - "user:me@me.com"
          - "user:you@me.com"
      - role: owner
        grants:
          - "user:me@you.com"
          - "user:you@you.com"
```


### Row level security

Row level security (RLS) allows you to restrict access to some rows in a table. This is done using the `rls` attribute in the table configuration file (load or transform).

```yaml
    rls:
      - name: "USA only"
        predicate: "country = 'USA'"
        grants:
          - "group:mygroup"
```
