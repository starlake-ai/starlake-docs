:::note

Make sure you have Java 11+ installed on your machine. You can check your Java version by typing `java -version` in a terminal.

If you don't have Java 11+ installed, you can download it from the following link:
[Download and install Java version 11+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

To install the starlake CLI, you need to download the starlake script from github.
The script will in turn download required dependencies and copy them to the bin subdirectory.

```shell
sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starlake-ai/starlake/master/distrib/setup.sh)
```

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

You may also run Starlake from a docker container. To do so, download this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/starlake-ai/starlake/blob/master/distrib/Dockerfile)
and build your docker image
	
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:starlake-ai/starlake.git
$ cd starlake
$ docker build -t starlake .
$ docker run -it starlake help

```

To execute the docker image, you can use the following command:

```shell

$ docker run -it -v /path/to/starlake/project:/starlake starlake <command>

```

Note that you can pass environment variables to the docker image to configure the CLI. For example, to run against AWS redshift, you can pass the following environment variables:

```shell

$ SL_ROOT="s3a://my-bucket/my-starlake-project-base-dir/"
$ docker run -e SL_ROOT=$SL_ROOT \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
    -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \
    -e REDSHIFT_PASSWORD=$REDSHIFT_PASSWORD \
    -it starlake <command>

```

The following folders should now have been created and contain Starlake dependencies.


```text

starlake
└── bin
    ├── deps
    ├── sl
    └── spark

```

:::note

Any extra library you may need (Oracle client for example) need to be copied in the bin/deps folder.

:::

Starlake is now installed with all its dependencies. You can run the CLI by typing `starlake` depending on your platform.

This will display the commands supported by the CLI.
